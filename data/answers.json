In case of activities identified as transitional in the Climate Delegated Act, the review would be conducted at least every three years to ensure the criteria remain on a credible transition pathway consistent with a climate-neutral economy. No minimum period is specified for the other activities. The TSC will be updated over time to keep them aligned with overall policy objectives, technological developments and the availability of scientifically robust evidence justifying the introduction of new or updated criteria.\n\nIn accordance with Article 20(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the Platform on Sustainable Finance shall advise the Commission on the development of additional TSC, including for additional activities, and updating of existing TSC.\n\nBased on this advice, the EU’s trajectory relative to its sustainability targets as well as on other feedback, the Commission may review the TSC and, where appropriate, amend the delegated acts establishing these criteria. As a result, the TSC could become stricter over time.",
  "1": "Yes, the Taxonomy will continue to be developed over time. As far as climate change mitigation (CCM) is concerned, the Climate Delegated Act prioritised economic sectors and activities with the highest potential to make a substantial contribution to GHG emission reduction based on their share of overall emissions and their potential to reduce emissions. The scope defined for CCM has been replicated for climate change adaptation(48)See Annex 6 of the impact assessment accompanying the first Climate Delegated Act for details available at: https://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/level-2-measures/taxonomy-regulation-delegated-act-2021-2800-impact-assessment_en.pdf. \n\nHowever, not all activities potentially contributing substantially to climate objectives were included in the first Climate Delegated Act. A Complementary Climate Delegated Act amending the Climate Delegated Act was adopted to cover as transitional activities certain economic activities involving specific gas and nuclear-related technologies that were not part of the Climate Delegated Act.\n\nIn addition, further activities contributing to the climate objectives may be included in the Climate Delegated Act at the time of its future review or of the adoption of any future delegated acts containing activities contributing to the other four non-climate environmental objectives.

  "2": "The checking of compliance with the TSC requires the collection and assessment of relevant information in order to determine if the economic activity fulfils the conditions set out in the TSC. All criteria related to substantial contribution and DNSH, as well as the minimum social safeguards referred to in Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation have to be met for an activity to be considered Taxonomy-aligned. For further guidance, users may consult the Taxonomy user guide on the Commission’s website(49)[add link when available]. ",
  "3": "The Climate Delegated Act contains specific verification requirements for certain activities, in line with point (k) of Article 19(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, which requires that the TSC are easy to use and be set in a manner that facilitates the verification of their compliance. This is the case where the criteria rely on elements that require specialist knowledge. The accuracy of such information would be difficult to check for investors. Therefore, the TSC for specific activities include external verification requirements for activities where such concerns are present. Where the Climate Delegated Act requires verification for certain activities, the report by the external verifier would constitute the evidence of compliance with those criteria. External verifiers can be either the relevant national competent authorities or an independent third-party verifier having no conflict of interest with the operator of the activity nor be involved in the development or operation of the activity.\n\nFor example, the forest management plans in Sections 1.1.-1.4. on the forestry activities are highly context specific, and therefore external verification of these plans and their implementation is necessary to give sufficient certainty to investors. For several energy and some manufacturing activities, such as ‘Manufacture of other low carbon technologies’ in Sections 3.6., ‘Manufacture of plastics in primary form’ in Section 3.17., ‘Electricity generation from geothermal energy’ in Section 4.6., specific thresholds for GHG emissions are central to the TSC, and their external verification can serve to inform investors of compliance with TSC. \n\nWhere required, details of the verification of the criteria should form part of the disclosure of Taxonomy-alignment. Taxonomy-verification requirements are set to evolve together with other sustainability-reporting under the CSRD, once it enters into application. ",

While several of the TSC set out objective thresholds and requirements which do not refer to any location-specific regulatory requirements, some TSC refer to jurisdiction-specific requirements laid out in EU legislation. In general, for assessing the Taxonomy-alignment of an economic activity conducted outside the EU, undertakings should ascertain whether it is performed in compliance with the requirement applicable in Union legislation or, where mentioned in the TSC, a relevant international standard or equivalent applicable national law in a third country (for instance, references to such standards in the generic DNSH criteria for biodiversity protection set out in [Appendix D](./assets/documents/None Appendix D.pdf) of Annex I).",

  "10": "The Commission acknowledges the need to ensure access to finance and investment including from the private sector for all strategic sectors, in particular the defence industry which contributes to European citizens' security. \n\nIn its communication of 15 February 2022 on European defence (COM(2022) 60) the Commission highlighted the need for initiatives on sustainable finance to remain consistent with the European Union efforts to facilitate the European defence industry’s sufficient access to finance and investment. The EU Sustainable Finance Framework focuses on ensuring transparency and does not impose any limitations to the financing any specific sector, including the defence sector.\n\nLike in any sector, undertakings involved in defence-related activities can claim Taxonomy-alignment for eligible horizontal investments stipulated in the Climate Delegated Act. This includes, for example, investments in greening their buildings, or investment in clean transport in the form of CapEx and/or OpEx referred to in point (c) of Sections 1.1.2.2. and 1.1.3.2 of Annex I to Disclosures Delegated Act. They can also claim alignment for any other activities identified in the Climate Delegated Act (for example activities in the field of transport, data solutions, manufacturing etc.). \n\nEU rules on sustainability disclosures apply horizontally across all industries equally and they do not single out a particular sector. \n\nThere is an explicit reference directly relevant for a limited part of the defence sector in one regulatory technical standard (RTS) under the Sustainable Finance Disclosures Regulation (SFDR), specifying further how financial market participants should disclose information about their principal adverse sustainability impacts (PAIs). This regulatory standard covers exposure to four categories of controversial weapons (anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical weapons, and biological weapons). For the remaining part of the RTS under the SFDR, the requirements (including on social aspects) are the same as for any other sector. \n\nSimilarly, the rules on MiFID/IDD sustainability preferences for retail investors apply horizontally across all industries equally and do not single out any specific sector. Therefore, they do not prevent investments in any specific sector. The principal adverse impacts taken into consideration in the financial product only concern the controversial weapons as referred to above. \n\nAs part of a broader work following up on the European Council conclusions of March 2022 to promote and facilitate access to private funding for the defence industry, the European Defence Agency launched in May 2022 a study to provide an overview of ESG frameworks applied on financial markets and how they regard defence industry or defence industry related activities. The aim is to measure and benchmark the European defence industry’s activities in relation to environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria, and provide an analysis of the sector’s contribution to the objectives set out by ESG-related frameworks.

  "11": "No. The mere fact that a company does not have Taxonomy-aligned activities does not mean that conclusions can be drawn regarding the company’s environmental performance or its ability to access finance. \n\nThere is also no obligation on companies to have activities aligned with the EU Taxonomy and there is no obligation on investors to invest in Taxonomy-aligned activities. \n\nOverall, there is likely to be a higher interest in Taxonomy-aligned activities from investors who are seeking sustainable investments. \n\nThere are several reasons why a company might not have economic activities that are eligible or aligned with the criteria of the EU Taxonomy: its economic activities might simply not be covered by the EU Taxonomy, or it may be covered but not make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective; or it might make a substantial contribution but not meet the do no significant harm criteria or the minimum social safeguards. Therefore, without knowing the exact reasons why a company has no Taxonomy-aligned activities, market participants cannot make investment decisions purely on the basis of Taxonomy-related disclosures of companies, because not having Taxonomy-aligned activities does not, in itself, reveal the company’s exact environmental performance. Instead, other disclosures, such as the company’s disclosures under the CSRD will help inform markets about the company’s environmental performance and the company’s direction of travel on environmental matters.\n\nJust as companies need to manage their portfolio of activities and should aim to gradually increase the share of green activities, similarly it can be expected that most investors will aim to gradually increase the share of sustainable investments in their portfolios. It is also important to keep in mind that financial market participants who are making decisions about allocating capital will take into account more elements than just the Taxonomy alignment. For all companies within the scope of the CSRD, even for companies not undertaking economic activities that are Taxonomy-aligned, investors will have at their disposal both (i) Taxonomy disclosures, and (ii) the information reported according to the CSRD. Aside from legally binding disclosures, companies can also make voluntary disclosures. Investors may use all of these disclosures when making investment decisions and financial products. Investors are free to design their investments as they wish and will continue to make investment decisions taking into account a large number of factors. ",

Other parties can include the ship broker who negotiates deals between ship owners and charterers, the shipping agent who takes care of the essential in-port details and the ship manager, who takes care of operating and crewing the vessel on behalf of the owner for a fee.\n\nThe charter party, i.e. the contract, defines the rate, duration, and terms agreed between the ship owner and the charterer. Many different types of charter contracts exist in practice: \n\n  *     * Voyage Charter - basic hiring of a vessel and its crew for a voyage between the port of loading and the port of discharge known as a voyage charter. In this type of contract, the ship owner is paid by the charterer either on a per-ton basis, or as a lump sum. Port costs, with the exception of stevedoring, fuel costs, and the crew costs are paid by the owner, and payment for the use of the vessel is known as freight.\n\n    * Time Charter - hiring of a vessel for a specific period of time, where the owner still manages the ship, but the charterer selects the ports, decides the routing, and has full operational control of the vessel for the duration of the contract. It pays the fuel costs, port charges, cargo handling costs, commissions, and a daily hire fee.\n\n    * Bareboat Charter – chartering arrangement where charterer has full control of the vessel.

If, on the other hand, the financing was provided to the charterer, to cover OpEx, then the relevant responsibility to demonstrate Taxonomy-alignment, would be on the charterer directly towards the financing institution.\n\nAs regards the mandatory disclosures pursuant to the Disclosures Delegated Act, the undertaking that generates revenues and/or incurs CapEx and/or OpEx related to this activity should assess their Taxonomy-eligibility and Taxonomy-alignment and report this in its KPIs.",

This is particularly the case in paragraph 1(d) of Section 6.10., according to which the vessels need to have attained an EEDI value 10% below the EEDI requirements applicable on 1 April 2022. The vessels have to be able to run on zero direct (tailpipe) CO2 emission fuels or on fuels from renewable sources (that meet the technical screening criteria specified in Sections 3.10 and 4.13 of Annex I), to prove that there is no lock-in of carbon-intensive assets.",

The ability to run on zero direct CO2 emission or renewable fuels represents an enabling provision in the criterion which does not impose, or further specify, which type of fuel to be used. \n\nFurthermore, the criterion does not impose further limitation on the use of different types of fuels during operation. In practice, the verification of the enabling condition is made with reference to the energy conversion system installed on board, rather than the fuel used.\n\nAs an example, a vessel equipped with dual fuel gas engines is able to use liquefied natural gas (LNG), but would also be “able to use” either liquefied bio or synthetic methane. \n\nThus, for compliance with the TSC, it is sufficient that the vessel meets the minimum EEDI requirements and is equipped and certified with energy conversion systems able to run with fuels that comply with the criteria in Section 3.10. or 4.13.",

Any vessel with such emissions does not comply with the requirement for having zero tailpipe CO2 emissions. Also, fuel cell installations, if using fuel other than hydrogen or ammonia will have CO2 emissions associated to the fuel reforming process.\n\nZero direct tailpipe emissions must be demonstrated based on the technological choices made for the propulsion installation.\n\nWithout considering the possibility of on-board carbon capture and storage (OCCS) the only possible options for zero tailpipe CO2 emissions would be technological solutions, such as:\n\n  *     * Electric ships, operated on an all-electrical configuration, with energy stored in batteries;\n\n    * Hydrogen Fuel Cell installations, with hydrogen or hydrogen carrier as source of energy;\n\n    * Ammonia Fuel Cell installations, with ammonia as source of energy;\n\n    * different combinations of renewable energy sources, directly used in propulsion assistance (e.g. wind assisted propulsion) or as energy source for electricity production (wind generators or photovoltaic).",

  "164": "The DNSH criteria for climate change adaptation, which are included in Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act, cover a part of the substantial contribution criteria for climate change adaptation, i.e. a risk and vulnerability assessment must be carried out to identify adaptation solutions.\n\nHowever, the substantial contribution criteria for climate change adaptation as included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act, add the requirement to _implement_ the identified adaptation solutions. The criteria for their implementation are specified in point 4 of the substantial contribution criteria. Thus, as regards to the implementation of adaptation solutions that substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks, material to the activity under scrutiny, the substantial contribution criteria for adaptation (included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act) reflect a higher level of ambition than those for DNSH in [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf) in Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act.\n\nSome economic activities cover only part of the value chain and have no impact on the part of the value chain that is predominantly threatened by climate change. How should this be addressed in the climate risk and vulnerability assessment?\n\nIt should be assured beyond reasonable doubt that the economic activity that is being targeted, cannot be affected by secondary or cascading impacts since major damage can often occur as a result of a succession of events (e.g. landslide after heavy rains). This can be done upfront or on the basis of the climate risk and vulnerability assessment. \n\nThe depth of the assessment may also vary, as long as it is sufficient to identify the physical climate risks that are material to the activity. For example, the extent to which risks may exist in the supply chain or in upstream production processes and whether these aspects need to be considered in the assessment can be weighed up individually for each activity. Decisive factors for the proportionality of the selected assessment approach can be the size of the company, the type, scale and context of the activity, the business model or the position in the supply chain.\n\nThe climate risk and vulnerability assessment needs to divide the economic activity (to the extent possible) into separate individual objects such as production sites, transport lines, adjacent administrative buildings, suppliers of critical material, their geographic location, etc. \n\nThe basis for a robust climate risk assessment is an understanding of how hazards can affect each individual object with regard to the activity under assessment. Some impacts of hazards are obvious, such as direct damage to production sites from flooding or storm events. However, not all climate impacts occur in a direct manner, but rather in succession with the potential of secondary impacts in a chain (so-called cascading effects). For example, storm events can damage the site of a critical supplier or energy infrastructure and cause power outages. Furthermore, risks can reinforce each other. Some risks even arise only through the combined effect of several climate hazards: some risks are exacerbated by successive hazards; for example, the risk of flooding is intensified when heavy rainfall hits dried-out soils.",

  "167": "No, it is not required to use all 4 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) pathways. \n\nTo start the assessment, it is important to see whether the activity that is subject to the climate risk and vulnerability assessment has been subject to impacts from some hazards in the past (e.g. sea-level rise). If this is not the case, following line with the precautionary principle, RCP 8.5 (i.e. low mitigation) should be always used. If positive, lower end scenarios, e.g. RCP 4.5 could be used. \n\nThe outcomes of each analysis should be assessed separately. ",
  "168": "In principle, the available IPCC models should be used at a scale that is meaningful and proportionate for assessing potential impacts from hazards within the timeframe of the economic activity (above 10 years).\n\nThe undertaking should make sure it has access to the climate data relevant for the climate risk assessment. This data is normally available on CORDEX. Regionalised climate data with the highest possible resolution should be requested from the national meteorological services. The European Environment Agency (EEA) provides an interactive report with climate data (based on CMIP5 and EURO-CORDEX) aggregated at the level of subnational administrative regions and already assigned to climate hazards. In addition, climate data for individual scenarios can be retrieved from the European Climate Data Explorer. \n\nRegarding the choice of adequate Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) to be taken into consideration, according to the [Technical guidance on the climate proofing of infrastructure in the period 2021-2027](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2021:373:TOC)(60)Commission Notice — Technical guidance on the climate proofing of infrastructure in the period 2021-2027 (OJ JOC_2021_373_R_000)., RCP 4.5 may be used for climate projections up to 2060 as until that year there are only small differences between the scenarios. However, for subsequent years, RCP 4.5 may begin to underestimate the changes, in particular, if GHG emissions prove higher than anticipated. Hence, it could be more relevant to use RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5 for current projections until 2100. Warming under RCP 8.5 is widely considered to be greater than current business-as-usual scenarios, but it has relevance from the perspective of risk management since tipping points could not be fully accounted for in IPCC projections, while climate change impacts have already been more pronounced than expected.",
  "169": "The objective of the robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment is to identify significant physical climate risks to the performance of the economic activity. This assessment then forms the basis for the identification of suitable adaptation measures that are presented as part of an adaptation plan. \n\nAccording to the Climate Delegated Act, Annex 1, [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf), the climate risk and vulnerability assessment carried out should follow state-of-the-art methodology and take into account the most recent highest-resolution data available. The scope of the assessment, methods and data used to achieve this objective may vary to maintain proportionality. For example, in many cases it may be enough to use a pessimistic scenario, such as RCP 8.5, and not consider all four RCP scenarios, provided that the consideration of additional scenarios is unlikely to yield new insights relevant for the risk assessment. \n\nThe depth of the assessment may also vary, as long as it is sufficient to identify the physical climate risks that are material to the activity. For example, the extent to which risks may exist in the supply chain or in upstream production processes and whether these aspects need to be considered in the assessment can be weighed up individually for each activity. Decisive factors for the proportionality of the selected assessment approach can be the size of the company, the type, scale and context of the activity, the business model or the position in the supply chain. For example, replacing windows in an office building to improve energy efficiency requires a less detailed climate risk assessment than building a dam to generate hydropower. \n\nThe frequency of the climate risk and vulnerability assessment should also be proportionate to its objectives. Appropriate occasions for updates of the assessment and the resulting adaptation plan are changes that increase the exposure to the identified risks or that may pose new risks or significantly alter already identified risks to the performance of the economic activity, such as changes in:\n\n  *     * the assessed economic activity, e.g. new suppliers or new production facilities;\n\n    * the climate data basis of the assessment, e.g. unforeseen changes in climatic systems, changes in assumptions for climate models, or technological advances in climate modelling.

Their report was published and reviewed by Member States' experts on radiation protection and waste management appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as by experts from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). Overall, the report and reviews conclude that compliance with the safety standards and waste management requirements under the regulatory framework in EU Member States ensures a high level of protection for the environment and for people.\n\nFor nuclear energy activities to be enlisted under the taxonomy, the screening criteria set requirements beyond the existing regulatory framework; for instance sunset dates for accelerating transition to advanced technologies, and definite dates for operational disposal facilities to be in place.",
  "190": "The [Taxonomy Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32020R0852) requires that the long-term disposal of waste does not cause significant or long-term harm to the environment.\n\nNuclear energy generates a relatively low amount of waste in comparison to the large amount of generated heat and/or electricity. It produces mainly low-level radioactive waste, for which there are disposal facilities that have operated for decades, while high-level radioactive waste accounts for 1% of total nuclear waste.\n\nThe EU regulatory framework establishes the legal requirement for national policies to keep the generation of radioactive waste to a minimum.\n\nIn addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy go beyond requiring mere compliance with legislation regarding radioactive waste management and disposal.  Notably, disposal facilities for low-level waste must be operational already, and Member States should have in place a detailed plan to have in operation, by 2050, a disposal facility for high-level radioactive waste. Some Member States have more advanced projects regarding the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. The inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Taxonomy can accelerate the development of solutions for final waste disposal elsewhere in the EU. In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy prohibit the export of radioactive waste for disposal in third countries.",
  "191": "During the public consultation conducted in November 2020 for the preparation of the Climate Delegated Act, the energy sector attracted the largest number of responses. Stakeholders notably commented on bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal plants, hydrogen and natural gas. Many stakeholders suggested that natural gas should be recognised for its role as a transition fuel in decarbonisation and that criteria for transitional activities should take into account different starting points across Member States and be attainable with existing technologies. The first EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act did not include any transitional activities in the energy sector. However, the European Commission committed to adopting a complementary Delegated Act capturing activities relevant for the climate objectives, but not yet reflected in the first Climate Delegated Act.\n\nThe European Union has translated the goal of the Paris Agreement into a long-term European growth strategy. Under the European Green Deal, the EU is working on implementing a comprehensive set of legislative proposals (most recently, [the Fit for 55 Package](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_3541)). The European Commission tabled its proposals based on robust evidence: the Fit for 55 Package rests on a common analytical base with energy system modelling at its core. According to the scenarios in this modelling, natural gas will continue to play an important role in terms of consumption and generation until 2030, after which we expect a decline to 2050. Throughout the transition of our energy system, the function of natural gas-fired electricity generation will change and will increasingly be a facilitator for the spread of renewable electricity and stable supply.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy complements these policies and plays a role in transitioning the financial sector to a more sustainable model. The Complementary Delegated Act has been prepared using the same coherent analytical base as the one of the [Climate Target Plan](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/european-green-deal/2030-climate-target-plan_en) and the Fit for 55 Package. The Commission's proposal is therefore consistent with the Commission's modelling underpinning its most ambitious legislative package for our climate. The Complementary Delegated Act recognises the specific role of natural gas-related activities in the transition. The carefully crafted set of technical screening criteria ensure that all relevant requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation are complied with. By identifying the role of natural gas in the transition, the Delegated Act also recognises the different situations in our Member States, while contributing to a sustainable transition.",
  "192": "The Taxonomy Regulation sets out that substantial contribution to climate change mitigation can be achieved through, among other things, the avoidance or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Article 10(2) complements this by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from solid fossil fuels – a requirement that has been taken into account in the technical screening criteria in the Complementary Delegated Act, along with the other requirements applicable to transitional activities. In the Commission's modelling for Paris-aligned pathways, natural gas is projected to represent 22% of gross inland energy consumption in 2030, and 9% in 2050. Any natural gas in 2050 will have to be abated.\n\nThe technical screening criteria ensure that any new gas-based power/heat plant (or refurbished combined heat and power plant or heat/cool plant) is either below the technology-neutral 100g CO2/kWh life-cycle emission threshold (i.e. using Carbon Capture and Storage technologies) or meets a number of stringent conditions and obtains a construction permit by 2030. Importantly, the use of gas should act as a replacement of plants running on more polluting solid and liquid fossil fuels (e.g. coal). As regards the co-generation of heat and power and heating/cooling activities, for every new natural gas-fired plant to be built, a coal-fired plant with the same capacity has to be removed for the technical screening criteria to be complied with. Regarding the power generation, the capacity of the gas-fired plant cannot exceed the capacity of the coal-fired plant by more than 15%. Facilities have to integrate a rapid conversion towards renewables with a clear commitment for a full switch to renewables by 2035.",
  "193": "Today's Complementary Climate Delegated Act:\n\n  *  **introduces additional economic activities from the energy sector into the EU Taxonomy.  **The Delegated Act includes in particular certain nuclear energy activities that can play a role, under strict conditions regarding nuclear and environmental safety (also related to waste disposal), in the EU's transition towards climate neutrality. It also covers some gas energy activities as transitional activities, subject to specific conditions which recognise the role gas can play to help some regions transition from the most polluting solid fossil fuel energy sources, such as coal, to renewable energy.\n\n  *  **introduces specific disclosure requirements for businesses related to their activities in the gas and nuclear energy sectors.  **Those requirements should further enhance the information provided to investors and improve transparency.\n\nMore specifically, this Complementary Climate Delegated Act covers the following activities:\n\n **Nuclear-related activities** :\n\n  1. Advanced technologies with closed fuel cycle (“Generation IV”) to incentivise research and innovation into future technologies in terms of safety standards and minimising waste (with no sunset clause);\n\n  2. New nuclear power plant projects for energy generation, which will be using best-available existing technologies (“Generation III+”), will be recognised until 2045 (date of approval of construction permit);\n\n  3. Modifications and upgrades of existing nuclear installations for the purposes of lifetime extension, will be recognised until 2040 (date of approval by competent authority)\n\n **Gas-related**   **activities** :\n\nEach gas-related activity needs to meet either of the following emission thresholds:\n\n  * lifecycle emissions are below 100gCO2e/kWh, or\n\n  * until 2030 (date of approval of construction permit), and where renewables are not available at sufficient scale, direct emissions are below 270gCO2e/kWh or, for the activity of electricity generation, their annual direct GHG emissions must not exceed an average of 550kgCO2e/kW of the facility's capacity over 20 years. In this case, the activity must meet a set of cumulative conditions: e.g. it replaces a facility using solid or liquid fossil fuels, the activity ensures a full switch to renewable or low-carbon gases by 2035, and a regular independent verification of compliance with the criteria is carried out.",
  "194": "In order to provide a high degree of market transparency regarding investments in natural gas and nuclear energy activities covered by this Delegated Act, financial and non-financial companies should present specific disclosure requirements that would show to what degree gas and nuclear energy activities, complying with the technical screening criteria, is in the numerator and denominator of the key performance indicators of those undertakings. This should help investors to distinguish among activities they invest in. With the help of this specific disclosure requirement, investors that are not willing to invest in nuclear and gas activities under the conditions in this Delegated Act would be able to identify and invest in activities and financial products that have no exposures to economic activities in the nuclear and gas sectors.\n\nIn addition, in order to provide a high degree of transparency to investors in financial products concerning exposures to fossil gas and nuclear energy activities, the Commission will explore amending further the disclosure framework pertaining to those financial products as appropriate, to provide for full transparency over the whole life of those financial products. To ensure that such information is clearly identified by end-investors, the Commission will consider amending the requirements on the financial and insurance advice given by distributors.\n\n## Taxonomy-Alignment Reporting",

  "203": "Before TSC for substantial contribution of activities to non-climate environmental objectives are established by future delegated acts, only Taxonomy-alignment with climate-related objectives may be assessed and disclosed (CCM) andCCA). \n\nThe contribution of a given activity to CCM or CCA should be assessed based on the nature of that activity. \n\nRegarding the CapEx KPI, and as mentioned in the last paragraph of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, the nature and scope of CapEx in an activity that contributes substantially to CCM could in some cases be differentiated – and hence easy to distinguish – from CapEx that make that activity adapted to climate change. This could be the case in situations where the adaptation solution is external to the CCM-aligned asset (i.e. a separately identifiable and implemented measure/project) or where a solution is specified in the adaptation plan of the existing activity/asset. For example, the CapEx to build an on-shore wind farm that is located near the sea shore, which should be assessed for CCM, should be distinguished from the CapEx to protect this wind farm from sea rises or sea-shore erosion, which should be assessed for CCA. \n\nOn the other hand, where the adaptation solution is an inherent part of the design of the new asset that is itself CCM aligned(35)DNSH TSC to CCA require that, for new activities and existing activities using newly-built physical assets, the economic operator integrates the adaptation solutions that reduce the most important identified physical climate risks that are material to that activity at the time of design and construction and has implemented them before the start of operations., it could be difficult to distinguish CCA related CapEx from CCM related CapEx. In that case, CapEx under CCM could also cover the CapEx on the inherent adaptation solution. For example, a new off-shore wind farm would need to be designed to be resilient to the impacts of the rising seas (i.e. to fulfil DNSH to CCA) in order to be CCM aligned. It might be difficult for the operator to have knowledge of comparative CapEx of an off-shore windfarm that is not adapted to rising seas. In such situations, the CapEx should be reported under CCM objective only.\n\nRegarding the turnover KPI, in accordance with the second paragraph of Section 1.1.1. of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, the revenue generated from an activity that is adapted to climate change may not be computed in the numerator of the turnover KPI of the undertaking unless that activity:\n\n  * is an activity enabling CCA(36)Activities enabling substantial contribution to climate change adaptation such as certain types of engineering, insurance and education could report the turnover KPI for CCA but not for CCM because there are no SC criteria for CCM for such activities., or;\n\n  * is aligned with CCM or any non-climate environmental objective. \n\nThus, the turnover generated from an on-shore wind farm that is adapted to climate change may only be counted in the turnover KPI of the undertaking where that wind farm is Taxonomy-aligned with respect to CCM and should be reported under the CCM objective. The turnover KPI for adaptation would not be reported for activities that are only adapted. \n\nFor adapted activities enabling a substantial contribution to CCA, the undertaking could count that respective turnover in the numerator of the turnover KPI under the CCA objective (column 6) with an E tag (column 20). Where such an activity also contributes substantially to CCM (e.g. afforestation), the undertaking could count that respective turnover in the numerator of the turnover KPI under the CCM objective (column 5)(37)Where the activity referred to in the previous sentence is not enabling, the turnover KPI under CCM objective should be reported on a separate line without the E tag. In all cases, the undertaking should avoid double counting in accordance with Section 1.2.2.2 of Annex I. KPI reported in column 4 should be the same figure as in column 18.. For example, a non-financial undertaking could report turnover from an afforestation activity in a location prone to risk of droughts with climate adapted trees (e.g. drought resistant trees) under the CCM objective (column 5) and report turnover from selling drought resistant seeds and saplings under the CCA objective (column 6).

A reporting undertaking should rather consider the adaptation solutions that it puts in place that could make the economic activity adapted/more resilient to climate change. In line with the reply to question 5 of the first Commission Notice, to demonstrate the Taxonomy-eligibility of an activity, an undertaking has to perform a climate risk and vulnerabilities assessment of the most important physical climate risks that are material to its economic activity. In addition, the undertaking must put in place a plan outlining how and by when adaptation solutions will be put in place to counter these physical risks. For instance, if a manufacturer of cement identifies that its manufacturing site is prone to avalanches, the entity may put in place a plan to install structural protection measures to hold back avalanches, such as avalanche barriers or snow racks. The existence of such a plan based on a climate risk and vulnerabilities assessment makes the economic activity Taxonomy-eligible for CCA. This Taxonomy-eligibility does not require the economic activity to meet all the TSC for CCA, i.e. to ensure that the adaptation solutions have already been implemented. ",
  "216": "Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act distinguishes between three types of economic activities eligible for climate change adaptation (CCA):   \n\n  1.  **Adapted activities** : \n\nThese are economic activities that can make a substantial contribution to CCA by being made climate resilient/adapted. This implies putting in place adaptation solutions that can counter the most important physical climate risks that threaten the activity, as identified in a climate risk and vulnerability assessment. These activities qualify as Taxonomy-aligned where they meet points 1 to 4 in the generic substantial contribution criteria for adaptation. For instance, if a manufacture of cement identifies that its manufacturing site is prone to avalanches, the entity may put in place a plan to install structural protection measures to hold back avalanches, such as avalanche barriers or snow racks. For these activities, only the CapEx and OpEx associated with putting in place the adaptation solutions can count as Taxonomy-aligned. The turnover of that activity may only be considered as Taxonomy-aligned if the activity itself is also Taxonomy-aligned (see Section 1.1.1 of Annex I) with respect to climate change mitigation (CCM) and then it should be counted towards the CCM objective only, or, when a delegated regulation adopted in accordance with Articles 12(2), 13(2), 14(2) or 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation enters into force, any other environmental objective (see replies to questions 5 and 8 of the first Commission Notice). Otherwise, these activities can only be reported under CapEx and OpEx KPIs.\n\n \n\n  1.  **Enabling activities** : \n\nThese are activities that can make a substantial contribution by providing adaptation solutions themselves that can enable another economic activity to reach a substantial contribution to one of the six environmental objectives referred to in Article 9 of the Taxonomy Regulation. The enabling character of these activities is explicitly stated in their description(49)The following sentence is added in the description of the activity: _”An economic activity in this category is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1) point (b) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 where it meets the technical screening criteria set out this section.”_. In addition, they do not follow the generic criteria of substantial contribution to CCA. These activities are limited to the following activities listed in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act:   \n\n  *     *  _9.1. Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change;   _\n\n    *  _9.2. Close to market research, development and innovation;  _\n\n    *  _10.1. Non-life insurance: underwriting of climate-related perils;  _\n\n    *  _10.2. Reinsurance.  _\n\nFor these activities the turnover, CapEx and OpEx associated with meeting the TSC set out in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act can count as Taxonomy-aligned. \n\n  1.  **Adapted-enabling activities** : \n\nThese are economic activities that combine the types 1 and 2 outlined above as they can make a substantial contribution to CCA by:\n\n  * becoming adapted themselves (adapted activity), and \n\n  * enabling other activities to make a substantial contribution (enabling activity).\n\nThese activities are identified by the following sentence in the description of the activity “ _Where an economic activity in this category complies with the substantial contribution criterion specified in point 5, the activity is an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that it meets the technical screening criteria set out in this Section_ ” . The activities that fall under this type must comply with the generic criteria for substantial contribution to CCA set out in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act with additional criteria related to the enabling character. Therefore, if the activity meets points 1 to 4 of the criteria for substantial contribution, it can qualify as an adapted activity. If it meets, in addition, point 5 of those criteria, the activity can also qualify as enabling. However, the activity first needs to be adapted itself to qualify as enabling. For instance, a school that is prone to subsidence may put in place concrete underpinning or jet grouting to make it resilient to climate change, therefore qualifying as an adapted activity. In addition, the school may offer some climate-related courses, which may stimulate individual climate action. \n\n \n\nFor these activities, the CapEx and OpEx associated with putting in place the adaptation solutions to make it climate resilient can count as Taxonomy-aligned with respect to CCA(50)Sections 1.1.2.2, final paragraph, and Section 1.1.3.2, fourth paragraph of Annex I. (in the above example, the CapEx for the concrete underpinning or jet grouting). In addition, the turnover and associated CapEx and OpEx of providing the adaption solution itself (e.g. climate related courses) can count as Taxonomy-aligned with respect to CCA.  ",
  "217": "Reporting entities must report turnover from the activities performed by a subcontractor in accordance with the accounting treatment referred to in Section 1.1.1. of Annex I of the Disclosures Delegated Act. Therefore, the reporting entity should determine whether it recognises revenue arising from that activity as its own revenue under the principles set out in the applicable IFRS 15. Where revenue generated by a subcontractor is recognised as the revenue of the reporting entity, it must be included in the calculation of the turnover KPI.\n\nAs an example: An entity is an actor in the logistics industry, and it provides freight transport services by road to its customers (activity 6.6 “ _freight transport services by road”_ described in the Climate Delegated Act as _“purchase, financing, leasing, rental and operation of vehicles designated as…”_ ). To deliver such transportation services, the entity either owns directly and operates some vehicles, or it outsources a portion of its activities by contracting with subcontractors or third party transport providers to provide the transport services to its customers, without puchasing, leasing, or operating directly the designated vehicles. \n\nTurnover is generated for the whole activity of transportation services independently of how (by whom) the services are performed; an outsourced activity is part of the general activity 6.6 “ _freight transport services by road”_ even if the entity does not purchase, rent nor directly operate the vehicles. For this outsourced portion of activities, the turnover KPI to be considered for Taxonomy disclosures is the one derived from the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 15.34 to B3.\n\nWhere the entity is determined as being a principal in the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the financial statements, it recognises revenue in the gross amount of consideration to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for the specified good or service transferred. When an entity that is an agent satisfies the performance obligation, it recognises revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which it expects to be entitled in exchange for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party.

In particular, IFRS 15 sets out criteria for the recognition of revenue on the basis of the performance obligations satisfied by the reporting entity, including cases in which multiple performance obligations constitute one single bundle to which revenue is entirely allocated. For the purpose of reporting the turnover KPI, those criteria should be followed to determine how to allocate revenue to different economic activities when multiple performance obligations are satisfied for the same customer or group of customers.\n\nFor example, an entity enters a contract to build a renewable energy production infrastructure for a customer. The entity is responsible for the overall management of the project and identifies various promised good or services, including engineering, site clearance, foundation, procurement, construction of the structure, installation of equipment and technologies, and finishing. The allocation of the turnover from this project to different economic activities follows the analysis that has been made in the financial statements in accordance with IFRS 15, i.e. depending on whether the goods and services are distinct or not from the accounting perspective.

If the expansion becomes operational in the same financial period when all the CapEx related to it is incurred, it could be counted under point (a) of Section 1.1.2.2.

On the other hand, where the expansion takes place over several financial periods, CapEx will be incurred in financial periods before the expansion is completed. In order to count that CapEx as Taxonomy-aligned in the financial period when it was incurred while the expansion is not yet completed, the undertaking should use the CapEx plan under point (b) of Section 1.1.2.2. The purpose of the CapEx plan is to provide a degree of assurance that the expanded activity will be Taxonomy-aligned when completed and allow, on that basis, to count CapEx as already Taxonomy-aligned while incurred in the periods before the expansion is completed.

More precisely, the Taxonomy Regulation specifies that ‘ _any undertaking which is subject to an obligation to publish non-financial information pursuant to Article 19a or Article 29a of Directive 2013/34/EU shall include in its non-financial statement or consolidated non-financial statement information on how and to what extent the undertaking’s activities are associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under Articles 3 and 9 of this Regulation_ '. In other words, undertakings that are subject to mandatory reporting obligations under the Accounting Directive, also have reporting obligations under the Taxonomy Regulation .\n\n.\n\nIn accordance with Articles 19a and 29a of the Accounting Directive, the following undertakings are subject to the obligation to publish non-financial information: a large undertaking as defined in Article 3(4) of that Directive which is a public-interest entity as defined in Article 2 point (1) of that Directive with more than 500 employees on average during the financial year; and a public-interest entity which is a parent undertaking of a large group as defined in Article 3(7) of that Directive with more than 500 employees on average on a consolidated basis during the financial year. Based on Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation, such undertakings are also subject to the Taxonomy Regulation related disclosure obligations. \n\nArticle 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation does not specifically refer to national measures transposing the NFRD that potentially extend the scope of its application to cover other categories of smaller undertakings. Therefore, the reporting requirements under Article 8(1) of the Taxonomy Regulation apply to undertakings directly in the scope of the NFRD. They do not apply to those undertakings covered only by national law transposing the NFRD. However, under the Disclosures Delegated Act, undertakings covered only by national law transposing the NFRD can report their alignment with the Taxonomy voluntarily.",
  "233": "The Taxonomy Regulation lays down a classification of environmentally sustainable economic activities. This classification is largely based on the Nomenclature of Economic Activities (NACE), the statistical classification of economic activities in the EU. \n\nAn economic activity takes place when resources such as capital, goods, labour, manufacturing techniques or intermediary products are combined to produce specific goods or services. It is characterised by an input of resources, a production process and an output of products (goods or services). \n\nRegulation EU 2021/2139 (the Climate Delegated Act)(5)Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139 of 4 June 2021 supplementing Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council by establishing the technical screening criteria for determining the conditions under which an economic activity qualifies as contributing substantially to climate change mitigation or climate change adaptation and for determining whether that economic activity causes no significant harm to any of the other environmental objectives, OJ L 442, 9.12.2021, p. 1. describes and assigns criteria on a high level. It does not refer to only one specific economic activity, but rather to categories of economic activities. For example, it sets criteria for the general category ‘manufacture of cement’, rather than the manufacturing of cement in one specific plant by one specific operator. \n\nThe reference to NACE sectors in the Climate Delegated Act is only indicative and not necessarily exhaustive. Therefore, an economic activity could match the description of an activity and the technical screening criteria laid out the Climate Delegated Act (Annexes I and II thereof) even if the NACE sector of the company is not listed in the relevant section of the Climate Delegated Act. ",
  "234": "Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act defines an eligible economic activity as an activity that is described in the delegated acts adopted under Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. For the reporting period ending in 2022 (and for activities conducted in 2021), this definition corresponds to economic activities described in the Climate Delegated Act as adopted on 4 June 2021. \n\nMore specifically, according to Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, an economic activity is eligible irrespective of whether it meets any or all of the technical screening criteria laid down in the Climate Delegated Act (and future delegated acts). Therefore, the fact that an economic activity is Taxonomy-eligible does not give any indication of the environmental performance and sustainability of that activity. \n\nIn principle, if an undertaking generates turnover or invests in capital expenditure (CapEx) or operating expenditure (OpEx) corresponding to an economic activity that is described in the Climate Delegated Act, it would count as eligible for Taxonomy-eligibility disclosure. On the contrary, if an activity is not yet included in the Delegated Act, it should not be considered as being eligible. Furthermore, the Taxonomy is a dynamic framework that should expand its scope of activities overtime, in particular by including other environmental objectives, which should expand the scope of eligible activities accordingly.\n\nIn practical terms, identifying Taxonomy-eligible economic activities is the first step towards assessing the alignment of economic activities with the Taxonomy technical screening criteria. Eligible activities constitute the baseline universe of activities that have the potential to align with the technical screening criteria, including as transitional or enabling activities. \n\nAs a general principle, eligibility reporting, in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, should serve to help undertakings prepare for their future alignment disclosures(6)For the sake of clarity, it is noted that eligible activities do not equal to the denominator of the taxonomy alignment KPI. For non-financial undertakings total CapEx, OpEx and turnover will be used. Covered assets for the KPI of financial undertakings..\n\nFinally, the Taxonomy Regulation, the Climate Delegated Act and the Disclosures Delegated Act do not differentiate between _core and non-core_ economic or business activities. Therefore, undertakings should report all of their economic activities in line with the definition of eligibility under Article 1(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, as explained above. \n\nThe timeline for eligibility and alignment disclosures is further described in the FAQs Question 2, [published on 20 December 2021](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/sustainable-finance-taxonomy-article-8-report-eligible-activities-assets-faq_en.pdf).",
  "235": "Articles 16 and 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation define enabling and transitional economic activities.(7)Please refer to Articles 10(2) and 16 of the [Taxonomy Regulation EU 2020/852](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32020R0852&from=EN). Transitional activities are those for which low-carbon alternatives are not yet available and that have greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector or industry, which fulfil the two following conditions: (i) they should not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives and (ii) they should not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets, considering the economic lifetime of those assets. On the other hand, enabling activities are those that directly enable others to make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective. \n\nFor eligibility reporting in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, economic activities defined as enabling or transitional activities should not be treated differently from other activities. If they are within the scope of the respective description, they should be identified as eligible. \n\nIt is noted however that an economic activity is only transitional or enabling under EU Taxonomy provided it meets the technical screening criteria in the respective section of Annex I and II to the Climate Delegated Act. Therefore, and in particular for the first year(s) of eligibility reporting in accordance with Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, those activities can only be considered as eligible-to be-transitional or eligible-to-be-enabling and reported i.e marked as such, on a voluntary basis. This is not different from eligibility reporting for other activities, where eligibility does not give an indication of the environmental performance of the activity. ",
  "236": "There are two different types of activities that can make a substantial contribution to climate change adaptation included in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act:\n\n  * adaptation activities, i.e. activities including adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11 (1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation.(8)Article 11(1)(a) of the Taxonomy Regulation EU 2020/852 refers to activities. including adaptation solutions that either substantially reduce the risk of the adverse impact of the current climate and the expected future climate on that economic activity or substantially reduce that adverse impact, without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on people, nature or assets;\n\n  * enabling economic activities, i.e. activities providing adaptation solutions in accordance with Article 11 (1)(b) of the Taxonomy Regulation.(9)Article 11 (1)(b) of the Taxonomy Regulation refers to activities thatprovide adaptation solutions that, in addition to satisfying the conditions set out in Article 16, contribute substantially to preventing or reducing the risk of the adverse impact of the current climate and the expected future climate on people, nature or assets, without increasing the risk of an adverse impact on other people, nature or assets..\n\nEligibility reporting requirements differ depending on whether the economic activity is marked as an enabling activity or an adaptation activity in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act. For the former category (enabling activities), the turnover and corresponding CapEx and OpEx can qualify as eligible activities.(10)In accordance with recital 48 of the Climate Delegated Act ‘...However, when the core business of economic activities enabling adaptation in accordance with Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 is to provide technologies, products, services, information, or practices with the objectives of increasing the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, nature, cultural heritage, assets or of other economic activities, in addition to capital expenditure, the turnover derived from products or services associated with those economic activities should be considered as proportion of turnover derived from products or services associated with economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable.’\n\nFor the latter category (adaptation activities), the reporting entity needs to demonstrate that a climate risk and vulnerability assessment has been performed and that an expenditure plan has been set up to implement adaptation solutions that reduce the activity’s most significant physical climate risks as set out in [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf) to Annex II. Only if these requirements are fulfilled can the reporting entity count the CapEx and OpEx of the adaptation activity for Taxonomy eligibility. \n\nIt is important to note here that the turnover derived from products and services associated with an adapted activity cannot be recognised for Taxonomy eligibility. This is because once the substantial contribution to climate change adaptation of an activity has taken place (i.e. once the activity has been made resilient to climate change), the turnover corresponding to that activity should not count as eligible. Note that the adapted activity may or may not provide environmental benefits.",
  "237": "NACE is a classification system for products and economic activities. NACE codes provide a framework to collect and present a wide range of statistics in economic fields, based on economic activity. \n\nNACE uses four levels. The National transpositions of NACE codes sometimes include more than four levels, but the first four levels are the same for all Member States.\n\nAll descriptions of economic activities included in Annexes I and II to the Climate Delegated Act provide that the economic activities in the respective category can correspond to one or more specific NACE codes. \n\nFurthermore, recital 6 of the Climate Delegated Act clarifies that the references to NACE codes should be understood as indicative. The assessment of Taxonomy eligibility should be made in view of the specific description of the activity provided in the Annexes of the Climate Delegated Act.\n\nMore specifically, NACE codes should help users navigate through the Taxonomy, in particular those users that already work with NACE codes. NACE codes can help identify taxonomy-eligible activities (not aligned ones). However, only the specific activity description in the Climate Delegated Act sets out the exact scope of the activities included in the Act. \n\nIn practice, this means that:\n\n  * if a NACE code is broader than the activity description, the description prevails over the scope of the NACE code; \n\n  * if an economic activity does not have a NACE code but does meet the activity description, it can qualify as Taxonomy-eligible;\n\n  * if an activity description does not fully correspond to the undertaking’s activity, it might be necessary to segment the undertaking’s activities so the respective parts can fall under the activity description or under several activities that are described separately;\n\n  * if the NACE code of an economic activity is not mentioned in the Climate Delegated Act, but the economic activity corresponds to the description of the activity, it can qualify as Taxonomy eligible.",

",
  "239": "Generally, reporting on Taxonomy eligible activities does not entail an assessment of an undertaking’s value-chain, as _in most cases_ the descriptions of the activities in the Climate Delegated Act do not contain value-chain references. Likewise, companies are not expected to assess the sustainability of their suppliers in particular in the phase of eligibility reporting.\n\nThe Taxonomy sets criteria per sector and activity, not per product line or company. Companies that generate revenue in several sectors within the value chain of one product, must disclose the various processes and parts in the value chain across those sectors and activities. This applies to activities that are carried out by the reporting entity, not by its suppliers. Operators that are active in several sectors across the value chain of one product or technology, but generate revenue from that product only under one activity, must disclose only under that specific revenue-generating activity. \n\nFor reporting turnover, assets and processes in the value chain of an activity are only eligible if they are explicitly included in the activity description. For example, if the description only refers to manufacturing of final products, intermediary activities in the value chain are not automatically eligible. Accordingly, manufacturing specific car and vehicle components is not automatically eligible under the section ‘manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport’”. From a supplier's perspective, this means that the activity of a company that is a supplier to a Taxonomy-eligible activity is not by definition Taxonomy-eligible and the manufacturing of specific components for cars is not by default eligible under the activity “manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport”. This is because the EU Taxonomy does not take a blanket approach for upstream activities. Instead it sets out specific criteria for each included activity, including the relevant ‘do no significant harm’ criteria.\n\nHowever, certain key components that are spelled out in separate Sections, such as for batteries or hydrogen (in Sections 3.2 and 3.4) are eligible.  Furthermore, the manufacture of components can qualify under the section “manufacture of other low carbon technologies” (Section 3.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act) where not covered by other sections and where they meet the activity description. As the activity description in Section 3.6 is very broad, NACE codes C22, C25, C26, C27 and C28 should be considered as advice for the scope of this activity. The scope of NACE codes for this activity notably includes tyres and semi-conductors, if those products meet the activity description (see also question 19). Mining, by contrast, would not be covered by the description. \n\nFor reporting CapEx and OpEx, all purchases of assets and processes or services that are essential to carry out a particular eligible activity are eligible as well. The components that car manufacturers purchase to manufacture low-carbon cars are eligible. Under eligibility reporting, the car- or vehicle manufacturers do not need to screen their suppliers and individual purchases. They must only determine whether their own manufacturing process is a Taxonomy-eligible economic activity. If the own activity is considered Taxonomy-eligible, the CapEx for investments in essential assets or components corresponding to that activity is considered Taxonomy-eligible. Another example is the purchase of software that is essential to develop or use ICT solutions for climate change mitigation, if these solutions are eligible under activity 8.2.\n\nFrom a client’s perspective, the purchase of outputs of Taxonomy-eligible activities is not by definition Taxonomy-eligible. For example, the purchase of renewable energy does not by definition qualify as Taxonomy eligible(13)This may be reviewed overtime in light of the Fit for 55 package and climate goals agreed by the Council and the European Parliament.. The purchase of Taxonomy-eligible output is only eligible when it can be reported as one of the various types of CapEx or OpEx described in Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, in particular such as for example the installation of solar panels on buildings covered by category (c) of CapEx mentioned in Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I of to the Disclosures Delegated Act (see also Question 11). ",
  "240": "The activity descriptions in the Climate Delegated Act serve as a reference point to identify Taxonomy-eligible activities. However, some descriptions contain “qualifiers” which could be understood in a subjective way, such as “low carbon”, which may in some cases impact the eligibility. \n\nEligibility does not depend on compliance with the technical screening criteria but is assessed solely on the basis of the description of the activity. The qualifiers, such as “low carbon” vehicles or “low carbon” vessels for the purpose of Section 3.3 in the Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act (“manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport”), which are not defined in a clear way, should only be taken into account for the purposes of determining the compliance with the technical screening criteria and are therefore not relevant for the reporting on eligibility. For example, a car manufacturer would be able to report as eligible all their car manufacturing activities, including those of combustion engine cars.\n\nOn the other hand, in the case of the activity “manufacture of other low carbon technologies” (Section 3.6) the description of the activity points to the objective of the activity. The activity covers manufactured technologies that are “aimed at substantial life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings in other sectors of the economy”. For any activity or product to be eligible for climate change mitigation under this category, the activity or product needs to have the objective of enabling a substantial reduction of GHG emissions in another sector of the economy. This means that if a technology is the best in their sector, but does not aim at substantial emission reductions in another sector, it would not be eligible. For example, a very energy efficient manufacturing process of a screw which does not aim to lead to emission reduction in another sector, would not qualify.\n\nIn a similar way, activity 10.1 in Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act (‘Non-life insurance: underwriting of climate-related perils’) refers to ‘climate related perils’. These are set out in [Appendix A](./assets/documents/None Appendix A.pdf) to Annex II to the Climate Delegated Act (‘Classification of climate-related hazards’). Insurance undertakings may only count a line of business as taxonomy eligible if it contains a policy with terms related to the treatment of climate perils.",
  "241": "Activities contributing to both climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation as defined in the Climate Delegated Act are within the scope of the first reporting year(s).\n\nArticle 10(2) and 10(3) of the Disclosures Delegated Act do not require the use of the reporting templates provided in the Annexes for eligibility reporting. They also do not explicitly require a distinction between environmental objectives for mitigation and adaptation in the first year(s) of eligibility reporting. \n\nHowever, advice is for undertakings to use on voluntary basis the templates included in the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act that require a split of environmental objectives for alignment reporting. \n\nThis suggestion is justified by the fact that when reporting their Taxonomy-alignment key performance indicators (KPIs) in accordance with the Disclosures Delegated Act, undertakings will be required to break down their economic activities based on their contributions across environmental objectives as specified in the tables of the Annexes to the Disclosures Delegated Act. This would make it easier to compare Taxonomy-eligibility reporting and Taxonomy-alignment reporting. It would also make reporting more consistent across undertakings’ first year(s) of eligibility reporting to prepare for their taxonomy-alignment reporting, on a voluntary basis. \n\nFor activities covered, climate change mitigation and adaptation largely overlap in scope. However, for reporting the alignment KPIs, it should be noted that there are some important differences between the two Annexes to the Climate Delegated Act catering for specificities for each objective. These differences are set out in the bullet points below.\n\n  * Certain activities are included only for climate change mitigation (Annex I) and not for climate change adaptation (Annex II), notably:\n\n    * ‘Data-driven solutions for GHG emissions reductions’ (Section 8.2);\n\n    * ‘Research, development and innovation for direct air capture of CO2’ (Section 9.2);and\n\n    * ’Professional services related to energy performance of buildings’ (Section 9.3).\n\n  * Certain activities are included only for climate change adaptation (Annex II) and not for climate change mitigation (Annex I), notably: \n\n    * ’Computer programming, consultancy and related activities’ (Section 8.2);\n\n    * ’Programming and broadcasting activities’ (Section 8.3); and\n\n    * ’Engineering activities and related technical consultancy dedicated to adaptation to climate change’ (Section 9.1). \n\n  * In addition, activities across the following sectors are only included for climate change adaptation: \n\n    * Insurance;\n\n    * education;\n\n    * human health;\n\n    * social work; and\n\n    * arts, entertainment, and recreation. \n\n  * Certain activities are included in both Annexes to the Climate Delegated Act but their names and descriptions differ. Notably, this concerns certain infrastructure for transport activities (Sections 6.15, 6.16 and 6.17) and certain manufacturing activities (such as Sections 3.2. and 3.4.). The names and descriptions of these activities were tailored to the specificities of the respective objective.\n\n  * Lastly, some inconsistencies in the titles and descriptions of activities in Annexes I and Annex II have been signalled. For example, the words ‘light’ and ‘renting’ are missing in respectively the title and the description of activity 6.5. ‘Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and commercial vehicles’ in Annex II. Any such inconsistencies should be signalled to the Commission for further correction. \n\nThe [briefing](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/overview-sustainable-finance/platform-sustainable-finance_en#activities)(14)Platform considerations on the reporting of voluntary information under Taxonomy-eligibility reporting. of the Platform on Sustainable Finance provides further advice on best practices for voluntary reporting for eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting.",
  "242": "The Disclosures Delegated Act sets out the definitions of Turnover, CapEx and OpEx key performance indicators (KPIs) in Sections 1.1.1, 1.1.2 and 1.1.3 of [Annex I](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2178&from=EN) respectively.\n\nNon-financial undertakings should disclose the part of their net turnover (as defined in Section 1.1.1. of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act) that corresponds to their Taxonomy-eligible economic activities. \n\nAs regards eligible CapEx information, in accordance with Section 1.1.3.2 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, reporting focuses on the three categories of CapEx:\n\na) CapEx that is related to assets or processes corresponding to Taxonomy-eligible economic activities; \n\nb) CapEx that is part of a plan to expand Taxonomy-eligible economic activities or enable Taxonomy-eligible economic activities to become Taxonomy-aligned.\n\nc) CapEx mentioned in category (c) of Section 1.1.2.2 of Annex I to the Disclosures Delegated Act, relating to the purchase of output from Taxonomy-eligible economic activities and individual measures enabling the target activities to become low-carbon or to lead to greenhouse gas reductions, notably activities listed in points 7.3 to 7.6 of Annex I to the Climate Delegated Act and other economic activities listed in the delegated acts adopted under Article 10(3), Article 11(3), Article 12(2), Article 13(2), Article 14(2) and Article 15(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nThe measures corresponding to category (c) must be implemented and operational within 18 months.\n\nFor CapEx category c), the assessment focuses on the output and individual measures. It does not focus on the target economic activity for which the expenditure is incurred. Entities must assess whether the expenditure qualifies as:\n\n  * a purchase of an output of a Taxonomy-eligible activity; or \n\n  * an individual measure to improve energy efficiency included in the Taxonomy. \n\nIn other words such outputs and measures must be listed in the Climate Delegated Act. Expenditures on assets or processes which might be useful to enable the target activity to become low-carbon but which are not activities listed in the Climate Delegated Act do not fall under category (c). \n\nFor a non-eligible target activity, for example a restaurant purchasing and installing solar panels, such expenditures could fall under category (c). For renovation of buildings, category (c) only covers measures corresponding to activities listed in the Climate Delegated Act (e.g. certain energy-efficient windows). \n\nThe reporting of OpEx for the first year(s) of implementation of the Disclosures Delegated Act must follow the same approach.

This is regardless of whether the investment under the CapEx plan will meet the technical screening criteria set out in the Climate Delegated Act at maturity. \n\nSimilarly, OpEx category (b) on eligible activities made in 2021 (and reported in 2022 disclosures) would count as eligible in the 2022 report.

They are also only required to report against activities contributing to climate objectives according to the [EU Climate Delegated Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2021:442:FULL&from=EN). \n\nAs a general principle, eligibility reporting in the first year(s) of reporting, as per Article 10 of the Disclosures Delegated Act, should serve to help undertakings prepare for their alignment disclosures. \n\nTo facilitate coherence in reporting between Taxonomy-eligibility and alignment reporting and to ensure coherence of the reporting across undertakings, it is suggested that financial undertaking-related disclosures should be based on actual information provided by the financial or non-financial underlying investee entity or counterparty, in accordance with Article 8(4) second subparagraph of the Disclosures Delegated Act.\n\nIn 2023, in accordance with Article 10(4) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, large non-financial undertakings will need to report the activities that are considered as aligned with the EU [Climate Delegated Act](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:L:2021:442:FULL&from=EN). \n\nSimilarly, and in accordance with Article 10(5) of the Disclosures Delegated Act, large financial institutions should disclose Taxonomy-eligible and aligned activities in 2024 for activities related to climate objectives.\n\nAfter a transition period of three years and as of January 2026, in accordance with the second subparagraph of Article 10(5), credit institutions will also need to report on the Taxonomy-alignment of their trading book and fees and commissions for non-banking activities.\n\ndata:image_2Chart 1: What undertakings should report and by when\n\n* Article 8 (2) and (3) Disclosures Delegated Act stipulates that information disclosed in accordance with this Regulation shall cover the annual reporting period from the previous calendar year of the date of disclosure and that financial undertakings and non-financial undertakings shall provide in the non-financial statement the key performance indicators covering the previous annual reporting period. Therefore, the first reporting period concerns the (fiscal) year of 2021. \n\nFor undertakings where the fiscal year is congruent with the calendar year the first reporting period is therefore the 1st of January 2021 to the 31st of December 2021. In the case an undertaking has a diverging fiscal year, only the last annual reporting period has to be covered. For instance if an undertaking has a fiscal year starting on the 1st of July and ending on the 30th of June it would mean that the first disclosures according to Article 8 Taxonomy Regulation would (only) have to cover the period 1st of July 2021 to 30th of June 2022 as this would be the previous annual reporting period.

  "287": "The goal of the EU Taxonomy is to prevent greenwashing and to help investors identify economic activities in line with our environmental and climate objectives. ** ** Shifting towards renewable energy is essential for achieving climate neutrality. But it is also necessary to have stable sources to accelerate the transition towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe [Taxonomy Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32020R0852) lays out three types of activities: low-carbon (Article 10(1)), transitional (Article 10(2)) and enabling (Article 16).\n\nIn this Complementary Climate Delegated Act, the Commission includes certain nuclear and gas activities in the second category of activities, i.e. transitional, those covered by Article 10(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation. These are activities that cannot yet be replaced by technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives, but do contribute to climate change mitigation and with the potential to play a major role in the transition to a climate-neutral economy, in line with EU climate goals and commitments, and subject to strict conditions, without crowding out investment in renewables.\n\nFurthermore, this Delegated Act also provides for specific disclosure requirements associated with natural gas and nuclear energy activities included in the act, by amending the Delegated Act on disclosures under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. This amendment will introduce requirements for large listed non-financial and financial companies to disclose the proportion of their activities linked to natural gas and nuclear energy. This should help investors to distinguish between the different activities they are investing in.",
  "288": "The Taxonomy Complementary Climate Delegated Act includes strict requirements for the activities to qualify. In the case of fossil gas-related activities, for example, the facility should switch fully to renewable or low-carbon gases by 31 December 2035. This can help accelerate the transition from high-emitting energy sources, such as coal, to renewable or low-carbon gases.\n\nNuclear power is low-carbon. Expert advice sought by the Commission as part of its preparatory work (the reports of the Technical Expert Group until 2020, and the report of the Joint Research Committee in 2021) confirms this.\n\nFollowing scientific advice, the Commission has concluded that nuclear energy, subject to strict safety and environmental conditions (including on waste disposal) that ensure the respect of the do no significant harm principle, can play a role in the transition towards climate neutrality in line with the European Green Deal.",
  "289": "The Technical Expert Group on Sustainable Finance, advising the Commission on Taxonomy, acknowledged that nuclear represents a low-carbon energy source. This is in line with the positions of international organisations such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which consider CO2 emissions from nuclear power plants over their life-cycle comparable to those from renewable energy sources (as low or even lower).\n\nHowever, expert opinion has been less conclusive on the other environmental impacts of nuclear power and its compatibility with the “do no significant harm (DNSH)” criterion. For this reason, the Commission set up a specific process on nuclear energy, involving a technical assessment by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commission's science and knowledge service. Their report was published and reviewed by Member States' experts on radiation protection and waste management appointed by the Scientific and Technical Committee under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty, as well as by experts from the Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks (SCHEER). Overall, the report and reviews conclude that compliance with the safety standards and waste management requirements under the regulatory framework in EU Member States ensures a high level of protection for the environment and for people.\n\nFor nuclear energy activities to be enlisted under the taxonomy, the screening criteria set requirements beyond the existing regulatory framework; for instance sunset dates for accelerating transition to advanced technologies, and definite dates for operational disposal facilities to be in place.",
  "290": "The [Taxonomy Regulation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32020R0852) requires that the long-term disposal of waste does not cause significant or long-term harm to the environment.\n\nNuclear energy generates a relatively low amount of waste in comparison to the large amount of generated heat and/or electricity. It produces mainly low-level radioactive waste, for which there are disposal facilities that have operated for decades, while high-level radioactive waste accounts for 1% of total nuclear waste.\n\nThe EU regulatory framework establishes the legal requirement for national policies to keep the generation of radioactive waste to a minimum.\n\nIn addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy go beyond requiring mere compliance with legislation regarding radioactive waste management and disposal.  Notably, disposal facilities for low-level waste must be operational already, and Member States should have in place a detailed plan to have in operation, by 2050, a disposal facility for high-level radioactive waste. Some Member States have more advanced projects regarding the long-term disposal of nuclear waste. The inclusion of nuclear energy in the EU Taxonomy can accelerate the development of solutions for final waste disposal elsewhere in the EU. In addition, the technical screening criteria for nuclear energy prohibit the export of radioactive waste for disposal in third countries.",
  "291": "During the public consultation conducted in November 2020 for the preparation of the Climate Delegated Act, the energy sector attracted the largest number of responses. Stakeholders notably commented on bioenergy, hydropower, geothermal plants, hydrogen and natural gas. Many stakeholders suggested that natural gas should be recognised for its role as a transition fuel in decarbonisation and that criteria for transitional activities should take into account different starting points across Member States and be attainable with existing technologies. The first EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act did not include any transitional activities in the energy sector. However, the European Commission committed to adopting a complementary Delegated Act capturing activities relevant for the climate objectives, but not yet reflected in the first Climate Delegated Act.\n\nThe European Union has translated the goal of the Paris Agreement into a long-term European growth strategy. Under the European Green Deal, the EU is working on implementing a comprehensive set of legislative proposals (most recently, [the Fit for 55 Package](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_3541)). The European Commission tabled its proposals based on robust evidence: the Fit for 55 Package rests on a common analytical base with energy system modelling at its core. According to the scenarios in this modelling, natural gas will continue to play an important role in terms of consumption and generation until 2030, after which we expect a decline to 2050. Throughout the transition of our energy system, the function of natural gas-fired electricity generation will change and will increasingly be a facilitator for the spread of renewable electricity and stable supply.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy complements these policies and plays a role in transitioning the financial sector to a more sustainable model. The Complementary Delegated Act has been prepared using the same coherent analytical base as the one of the [Climate Target Plan](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/eu-action/european-green-deal/2030-climate-target-plan_en) and the Fit for 55 Package. The Commission's proposal is therefore consistent with the Commission's modelling underpinning its most ambitious legislative package for our climate. The Complementary Delegated Act recognises the specific role of natural gas-related activities in the transition. The carefully crafted set of technical screening criteria ensure that all relevant requirements of the Taxonomy Regulation are complied with. By identifying the role of natural gas in the transition, the Delegated Act also recognises the different situations in our Member States, while contributing to a sustainable transition.",
  "292": "The Taxonomy Regulation sets out that substantial contribution to climate change mitigation can be achieved through, among other things, the avoidance or reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Article 10(2) complements this by phasing out greenhouse gas emissions, in particular emissions from solid fossil fuels – a requirement that has been taken into account in the technical screening criteria in the Complementary Delegated Act, along with the other requirements applicable to transitional activities. In the Commission's modelling for Paris-aligned pathways, natural gas is projected to represent 22% of gross inland energy consumption in 2030, and 9% in 2050. Any natural gas in 2050 will have to be abated.\n\nThe technical screening criteria ensure that any new gas-based power/heat plant (or refurbished combined heat and power plant or heat/cool plant) is either below the technology-neutral 100g CO2/kWh life-cycle emission threshold (i.e. using Carbon Capture and Storage technologies) or meets a number of stringent conditions and obtains a construction permit by 2030. Importantly, the use of gas should act as a replacement of plants running on more polluting solid and liquid fossil fuels (e.g. coal). As regards the co-generation of heat and power and heating/cooling activities, for every new natural gas-fired plant to be built, a coal-fired plant with the same capacity has to be removed for the technical screening criteria to be complied with. Regarding the power generation, the capacity of the gas-fired plant cannot exceed the capacity of the coal-fired plant by more than 15%. Facilities have to integrate a rapid conversion towards renewables with a clear commitment for a full switch to renewables by 2035.",
  "293": "Today's Complementary Climate Delegated Act:\n\n  *  **introduces additional economic activities from the energy sector into the EU Taxonomy.  **The Delegated Act includes in particular certain nuclear energy activities that can play a role, under strict conditions regarding nuclear and environmental safety (also related to waste disposal), in the EU's transition towards climate neutrality. It also covers some gas energy activities as transitional activities, subject to specific conditions which recognise the role gas can play to help some regions transition from the most polluting solid fossil fuel energy sources, such as coal, to renewable energy.\n\n  *  **introduces specific disclosure requirements for businesses related to their activities in the gas and nuclear energy sectors.  **Those requirements should further enhance the information provided to investors and improve transparency.\n\nMore specifically, this Complementary Climate Delegated Act covers the following activities:\n\n **Nuclear-related activities** :\n\n  1. Advanced technologies with closed fuel cycle (“Generation IV”) to incentivise research and innovation into future technologies in terms of safety standards and minimising waste (with no sunset clause);\n\n  2. New nuclear power plant projects for energy generation, which will be using best-available existing technologies (“Generation III+”), will be recognised until 2045 (date of approval of construction permit);\n\n  3. Modifications and upgrades of existing nuclear installations for the purposes of lifetime extension, will be recognised until 2040 (date of approval by competent authority)\n\n **Gas-related**   **activities** :\n\nEach gas-related activity needs to meet either of the following emission thresholds:\n\n  * lifecycle emissions are below 100gCO2e/kWh, or\n\n  * until 2030 (date of approval of construction permit), and where renewables are not available at sufficient scale, direct emissions are below 270gCO2e/kWh or, for the activity of electricity generation, their annual direct GHG emissions must not exceed an average of 550kgCO2e/kW of the facility's capacity over 20 years. In this case, the activity must meet a set of cumulative conditions: e.g. it replaces a facility using solid or liquid fossil fuels, the activity ensures a full switch to renewable or low-carbon gases by 2035, and a regular independent verification of compliance with the criteria is carried out.",
  "294": "In order to provide a high degree of market transparency regarding investments in natural gas and nuclear energy activities covered by this Delegated Act, financial and non-financial companies should present specific disclosure requirements that would show to what degree gas and nuclear energy activities, complying with the technical screening criteria, is in the numerator and denominator of the key performance indicators of those undertakings. This should help investors to distinguish among activities they invest in. With the help of this specific disclosure requirement, investors that are not willing to invest in nuclear and gas activities under the conditions in this Delegated Act would be able to identify and invest in activities and financial products that have no exposures to economic activities in the nuclear and gas sectors.\n\nIn addition, in order to provide a high degree of transparency to investors in financial products concerning exposures to fossil gas and nuclear energy activities, the Commission will explore amending further the disclosure framework pertaining to those financial products as appropriate, to provide for full transparency over the whole life of those financial products. To ensure that such information is clearly identified by end-investors, the Commission will consider amending the requirements on the financial and insurance advice given by distributors.\n\n## Disclosures Delegated Act - General",

The main KPIs for non-financial companies include:\n\nThe **turnover** KPI represents the proportion of the net turnover derived from products or services that are taxonomy-aligned. The Turnover KPI gives a static view of the companies contribution to environmental goals.\n\nThe **CapEx** KPI represents the proportion of the capital expenditure of an activity that is either already taxonomy-aligned or is part of a credible plan to extend or reach taxonomy-alignment. CapEx provides a dynamic and forward-looking view of companies’ plans to transform their business activities.\n\nThe **OpEx** KPI represents the proportion of the operating expenditure associated with taxonomy-aligned activities or to the CapEx plan.

However, it is expected that over time, the EU Taxonomy will be an enabler of change and encourage a transition towards sustainability.\n\nEconomic activities that are not recognised by the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts as substantially contributing to one of the EU’s climate and environmental objectives are not necessarily environmentally harmful or unsustainable. And not all activities that can make a substantial contribution to the environmental objectives are yet part of the EU Taxonomy Delegated Acts. Delegated acts will be living documents that will be added to over time and updated as necessary. ",
  "307": "The EU Taxonomy provides a common understanding of economic activities that make a substantial contribution to the EU’s environmental goals, by providing consistent, objective criteria in delegated acts. The Taxonomy Regulation tasks the Commission with establishing these technical screening criteria through delegated acts. \n\nThe first delegated act under the EU Taxonomy on climate objectives sets criteria for economic activities in the sectors that are most relevant for achieving climate neutrality and delivering on climate change adaptation. This includes sectors such as energy, forestry, manufacturing, transport and buildings. The process leading up to the adoption of this Delegated Act is explained in the answer to question 18.\n\nCriteria for other environmental goals will follow in a later delegated act, in line with the mandates in the Taxonomy Regulation. The Commission is currently preparing an IT tool to facilitate the use of the Taxonomy by allowing users to find the criteria more easily, for example by selecting the type of economic activity they are interested in. ",
  "308": "We need reliable tools to support companies in the transition to climate neutrality and a sustainable economy. The EU Taxonomy is one such tool, translating the climate and environmental objectives into clear criteria, to create a common language around green activities. It will create a frame of reference for investors and companies. It will support companies in their efforts to plan and finance their transition, help mitigate market fragmentation, protect against greenwashing and accelerate financing of those projects that are already sustainable and those in transition, to deliver on the objectives of the European Green Deal.\n\nIt is an important element of a much broader sustainable finance framework that will deliver a complete toolkit for financing the transition. The added value of the EU Taxonomy is that it can help scale up investment in green projects that are necessary to implement the European Green Deal.",
  "309": "There are three disclosure tools that create one coherent framework:\n\n  * The[ Non-Financial Reporting](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/non-financial-reporting_en) [Directive (NFRD)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/non-financial-reporting_en) is currently being revised (named after revision as Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive - CSRD), with the aim of delivering a comprehensive corporate reporting framework with qualitative and quantitative information to facilitate the assessment of companies’ sustainability impacts and risks. \n\n  * The **EU Taxonomy** establishes a common understanding of green economic activities that make a substantial contribution to EU environmental goals, by providing consistent, objective criteria. Together with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) these two instruments will ensure that companies falling under the scope of the CSRD disclose the environmental performance information of the company as well as information about a company’s Taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\n\n  * The[ Sustainable Finance Disclosure](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/sustainability-related-disclosure-financial-services-sector_en) [Regulation (SFDR)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/sustainability-related-disclosure-financial-services-sector_en) applies from 10 March 2021 and complements corporate disclosures by creating a comprehensive reporting framework for financial products and financial entities. Compliance with sustainability-related disclosures is expected to have considerable behavioural effects on financial firms, and indirectly on the business models of companies that are being invested in. Different investment strategies may entail investments in economic activities with different levels of environmental performance. For this reason, the SFDR distinguishes disclosure requirements for:\n\n  * financial products that claim to have ‘sustainable investment’ as their objective (in the case of environmental objectives these are often referred to as ‘dark green’ financial products);\n\n  * financial products that claim to be promoting social or environmental characteristics (often referred to as ‘light green’ financial products).\n\nThe SFDR requirements are linked with those under the EU Taxonomy by including ‘environmentally sustainable economic activities’ as defined by the Taxonomy Regulation in the definition of ‘sustainable investments’ in the SFDR. But neither the SFDR nor the Taxonomy Regulation provide criteria and define eligible investments or strategies for so-called ‘light green’ financial products. Therefore, the ESG ambition of ‘light green’ financial products may vary: for example, certain ‘light green’ financial products may partially pursue sustainable investments. Regulatory technical standards jointly developed by ESMA, EBA and EIOPA further specify disclosure requirements for ‘dark green’ and ‘light green’ financial products in terms of substance as well as presentation of information by means of standardised templates across the financial services sectors.",
  "310": "[The Taxonomy Regulation ](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32020R0852)lays out six EU environmental objectives: \n\n  * climate change mitigation,\n\n  * climate change adaptation, \n\n  * sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, \n\n  * transition to a circular economy, \n\n  * pollution prevention and control, and\n\n  * protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nIt also sets out four conditions that an economic activity has to meet to be recognised as Taxonomy- aligned:\n\n  * making a substantial contribution to at least one environmental objective;\n\n  * doing no significant harm to any other environmental objective;\n\n  * complying with minimum social safeguards;\n\n  * complying with the technical screening criteria.\n\nThis technical screening criteria are developed in delegated acts. For each economic activity considered, the technical screening criteria specify environmental performance requirements that ensure the activity makes a **substantial contribution to the environmental objective** in question and **does no significant harm** to the other environmental objectives.\n\nThe technical screening criteria for ‘substantial contribution’ to an environmental objective ensure that the economic activity either has a substantial positive environmental impact or substantially reduces negative impacts on the environment, e.g. substantially reduced levels of greenhouse gas emissions. \n\nThe technical screening criteria for ‘do no significant harm’ ensure that the economic activity does not impede on the other environmental objectives from being reached, i.e. it has no significant negative impact on them. \n\nBoth sets of criteria together ensure coherence between the objectives in the EU Taxonomy and guarantee that progress towards one objective is not made at the expense of another.\n\nThe performance thresholds in these criteria are science-based and developed on the basis of a robust methodology and an inclusive process. They identify criteria for economic activities that can set sectors on a path consistent with the EU’s climate and environmental goals, based on currently available technologies.\n\nSubstantial contribution to climate change mitigation, for example, means levels of performance that are aligned with climate neutrality and limiting the increase in temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius globally. For climate change adaptation this means the implementation of solutions to substantially reduce the most significant identified climate risks to a particular activity such as wildfires, storms or droughts. The Taxonomy Regulation calls such activities ‘environmentally sustainable’: but this does not mean that activities that do not meet these four conditions are ‘unsustainable’.\n\nEconomic activities can make a substantial contribution through the specific means listed in Articles 10 to 15 of the Taxonomy Regulation. Based on these provisions, the draft Delegated Act contains a number of activities that can make a substantial contribution and defines criteria for those activities to qualify as green under the EU Taxonomy. The methodology used by the Commission is based on the work by the Technical Expert Group (TEG). It considers that activities can make a substantial contribution when: \n\n  * they have a low impact on the environment and have the potential to replace high impact activities (e.g. renewable energy);\n\n  * they reduce impact from other activities (e.g. wastewater treatment); or\n\n  * they make a positive environmental contribution (e.g. restoration of wetlands).\n\nThese are not types of activities explicitly listed in the Taxonomy Regulation. Instead, they are ways to understand and frame the concept of ‘substantial contribution’, based on Articles 10 to 15 of the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nIn addition, the Taxonomy Regulation explicitly recognises two specific types of activities that also make a substantial contribution. First, for the climate change mitigation objective, it recognises ‘transitional activities’. These are activities for which low-carbon alternatives are not yet available and that have greenhouse gas emission levels that correspond to the best performance in the sector or industry. For example, this might include best-in-class cement manufacturing. Nevertheless, there are two conditions: (i) they should not hamper the development and deployment of low-carbon alternatives and (ii) they should not lead to a lock-in of carbon-intensive assets, considering the economic lifetime of those assets.\n\nThe second specific type of activity recognised as making a substantial contribution is referred to as ‘enabling activities’. These are activities that directly enable others to make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective. For example, this could include manufacturing of renewable energy technologies, installation of energy efficiency equipment in buildings, research into materials for stronger flood defences, or use of cover crops that reduce the risk of flooding for an area.",
  "311": "The EU Taxonomy recognises as ‘green’ activities those that – beside doing no significant harm and meeting minimum social safeguards – make a **substantial** , rather than a marginal, contribution to reaching the EU’s environmental objectives. It sets the criteria based on a level of ambition that strengthens the EU’s credibility and signals the activities that can substantially contribute to the goals of the European Green Deal. Given the huge investment needs and the necessary broad transformation of the EU economy, less than substantial improvements on the current levels of environmental performance - while still important - will in themselves not be sufficient to reach our green objectives.\n\nAlignment with EU sectoral policies is an important consideration. But there are good reasons why the Taxonomy criteria might both integrate and go beyond sectoral policies, the prevailing aim being alignment of the Taxonomy criteria with the ambition of the European Green Deal objectives. Also, there is a particular difference between requirements for a ‘substantial contribution’ and requirements for ‘doing no significant harm’.\n\nEstimates and early testing of the climate taxonomy criteria show a low overall Taxonomy alignment today in companies’ activities and investment portfolios (between 1% and 5%, with many companies and investment portfolios standing at zero). While this figure is expected to rise significantly with the implementation of the Green Deal, it highlights the extent of the transition still required towards carbon neutrality by 2050.",
  "312": "The European Parliament and the Council have prioritised economic activities that can make the most relevant contribution to the two environmental objectives under consideration. This first Delegated Act focuses on the climate objectives (climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation) and therefore includes activities that are most relevant for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and for improving climate resilience. This includes sectors with the highest contribution to CO2 emissions (energy, manufacturing, transport, buildings), as well as activities enabling their transformation, because the transformation of activities in these sectors is necessary to reach the EU’s climate objectives. \n\nThrough the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act, the EU Taxonomy criteria cover the economic activities of roughly 40% of listed companies,(0)Share of EU domiciled companies with more than 500 employees active in economic sectors covered by the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act (Source: Bloomberg). in sectors which are responsible for almost 80% of direct greenhouse gas emissions in Europe.(1)Source: Eurostat. Through this coverage, the EU Taxonomy can significantly increase the potential that green financing offers to support transition, in particular for carbon-intensive sectors where change is urgently needed. \n\nIt was not possible however to develop criteria for all sectors where activities could conceivably make a substantial contribution. The EU Taxonomy will be developed gradually over time, and further delegated acts, or revisions of existing ones, will likely include other economic activities from different sectors and sub-sectors of the economy, as these become relevant and feasible to be integrated into the EU Taxonomy. For example, the review of the criteria on forest management and bioenergy are foreseen in the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act itself. \n\nStakeholders will have an opportunity to notify the Platform on Sustainable Finance about activities they believe should be covered in the EU Taxonomy. The assessment of further economic activities will also be based on scientific evidence and broad stakeholder input. Gradually, additional sectors will be considered and additional activities will be included. For more information on the EU Taxonomy, including information on the gradual inclusion of economic sectors and activities, please see the[ FAQ ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/200610-sustainable-finance-teg-taxonomy-green-bond-standard-faq_en.pdf)previously prepared by the Commission and Technical Expert Group on EU Taxonomy & EU Green Bond Standard.\n\nFurthermore, the Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act reflects a delicate compromise on whether or not to include nuclear energy and natural gas among the activities covered by the Act. For this reason, in line with the legal framework and our past commitments, the Commission will adopt a complementary delegated act of the EU Taxonomy Regulation covering activities not yet covered in the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act such as agriculture, certain energy sectors and certain manufacturing activities. An additional delegated act will cover the other four environmental objectives as set out in the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\nA specific review process is underway on the role of nuclear energy as part of the Taxonomy Regulation, based on the report delivered by the Joint Research Centre,(2)[JRC report: Technical assessment of nuclear energy with respect to the ‘do no significant harm’ criteria of Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (‘Taxonomy Regulation’) | European Commission (europa.eu)](https://ec.europa.eu/info/file/210329-jrc-report-nuclear-energy-assessment_en) which is now being assessed by two expert committees,(3)The [Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/scheer_en), as well as the [Scientific Committee on Health, Environmental and Emerging Risks](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/scheer_en) on environmental impacts. which will finalise their review in June 2021. The Commission will adopt this complementary Delegated Act as soon as possible after the end of this specific review process. This complementary delegated act will also cover natural gas and related technologies as transitional activity in as far as they fall within the limits of Article 10(2) of the EU Taxonomy Regulation. \n\nFinally, a separate delegated act will focus on activities making a substantial contribution the other four environmental objectives as set out in the EU Taxonomy Regulation (sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems). The Platform on Sustainable Finance is working on recommendations for this act.\n\nIn addition, Article 26 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation requires the Commission to assess by the end of 2021 whether and how the scope of the Taxonomy Regulation could be extended to cover other levels of environmental performance than substantial contribution, as well as other objectives, such as social objectives.",
  "313": "There are some mandatory disclosure rules defined in the Taxonomy Regulation. Alongside these, companies can also use the EU Taxonomy voluntarily.",
  "314": "The EU Taxonomy Regulation sets mandatory requirements on disclosure, with the aim of providing transparency on environmental performance.\n\nLarge financial and non-financial companies that fall under the scope of the Non-Financial Reporting Directive will have to disclose to what extent the activities that they carry out meet the criteria set out in the EU Taxonomy. Likewise, financial market participants (such as asset managers) will have to disclose to what extent the activities that their financial products fund meet the EU Taxonomy criteria. Companies will be able to disclose the extent to which they invest, for example through capital expenditures, in either expanding or strengthening their activities which are already Taxonomy-aligned, or to upgrade other activities to make them Taxonomy-aligned. Disclosure on green revenue and green expenditure will provide the market with information on (1) companies whose activities comply with the EU Taxonomy criteria (through disclosure of share revenue from Taxonomy-aligned activities) and (2) companies that are taking steps to get there (through disclosure of green expenditure).\n\nFor more information on reporting obligations, please see the[ FAQ ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/200610-sustainable-finance-teg-taxonomy-green-bond-standard-faq_en.pdf)previously prepared by the Commission and Technical Expert Group on the EU Taxonomy & EU Green Bond Standard.

  "315": "There are many possible voluntary uses of the EU Taxonomy by market participants, which are not defined in policy instruments. For example, companies can use the criteria of the EU Taxonomy as an input to their environmental and sustainability transition strategies and plans.

Investors can choose to use the EU Taxonomy criteria in their due diligence for screening and identifying sustainable investment opportunities aiming to achieve a positive environmental impact.",
  "316": "Green standards and labels\n\nThe Taxonomy Regulation requires Member States and the EU to use the EU Taxonomy as the basis of any EU or national (public) labels for green corporate bonds or financial products that fall under the scope of the SFDR. The EU Taxonomy therefore provides a good basis for the development of further sustainable finance tools, including the EU[ Ecolabel for R](https://susproc.jrc.ec.europa.eu/product-bureau/product-groups/432/home)etail Financial Products and future EU standards for[ green bonds ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/banking-and-finance/sustainable-finance/eu-green-bond-standard_en)(all under development) as well as green mortgages.\n\nOngoing EU policy initiatives will link standards and labels to Taxonomy aligned economic activities:\n\n  * In the current draft EU Ecolabel criteria for financial products, there is a requirement for a certain share of underlying activities invested in to be Taxonomy aligned. Thus, the EU Ecolabel will be awarded to financial products only if the companies they invest in carry out Taxonomy-aligned activities. It will be useful to have an ecolabel for financial products especially for retail investors who have corresponding sustainability preferences.\n\n  * The EU Green Bond Standard (GBS) will define requirements for entities wishing to issue green bonds and claim compliance with this standard. These standards will include a requirement for companies to ensure that the proceeds raised through a bond issuance are used to finance Taxonomy-aligned activities.\n\n  * The EU Climate Benchmarks Regulation lays down minimum standards for the creation of two types of climate benchmarks - EU climate transition and EU Paris-aligned benchmarks. These are to be made consistent with the EU Taxonomy by the end of 2022. The Commission will reflect on how to implement this obligation in practical terms and what obligations will be put on benchmark administrators for the selected companies or entities to form part of such benchmarks. It could be that benchmark administrators have to select companies that have a certain percentage of their activities classified as green as per the Taxonomy or that companies are excluded because they do not meet certain thresholds. The two EU climate benchmarks are largely used by market participants for the allocation of assets and should contribute to showcasing companies that have an impact on tackling climate change.\n\nEU instruments making reference to the EU Taxonomy\n\nIn addition to the mandatory uses set out in the Taxonomy Regulation discussed above, there are other EU (or national) policies that may refer to the Taxonomy Regulation. Such uses are not defined or mandated in the Taxonomy Regulation itself, but in other policy instruments, and do not necessitate the use of the Taxonomy criteria defined in the associated delegated acts. One area where the EU Taxonomy framework might be used, if deemed appropriate, is the design of financial support schemes or financial products. National Promotional Banks or Institutions may make reference to the EU Taxonomy framework to provide financial support to green investments at national level, or when proposing financing for green projects under the[ InvestEU ](https://europa.eu/investeu/home_en)Programme.\n\nAnother important example is the use of the ‘do no significant harm’ principle of the Taxonomy Regulation in the[ Recovery and Resilience Facility ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/business-economy-euro/recovery-coronavirus/recovery-and-resilience-facility_en)(RRF). Here, the ‘do no significant harm principle’ is applied within the meaning of Article 17 of the Taxonomy Regulation but without requiring the use of the delegated acts and related technical screening criteria. Instead, the Commission published on 12 February 2021 a technical guidance document, providing more details on how to apply the ‘do no significant harm’ principle for the purposes of the RRF.\n\nSimilarly, based on the political agreement reached between the Council and the European Parliament on new rules for EU regional, cohesion and social funds for the period of 2021-2027, budget expenditure as part of those funds will also need to respect the ‘do no significant harm’ principle within the meaning of Article 17 of the Taxonomy Regulation. For the 2021/2022 work programme, the ‘do no significant harm’ principle was introduced when setting the call topics under the new EU Research Framework Programme,[ Horizon Europe.](https://ec.europa.eu/info/horizon-europe_en%23:~:text=%2520Horizon%2520Europe%2520%25201%2520Implementing%2520Horizon%2520Europe,European%2520partnerships%2520with%2520EU%2520countries,%2520the...%2520More)",
  "317": "Companies that fall under the scope of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) will be disclosing to the financial markets whether or not they have Taxonomy-aligned activities. Investors will have access to this information and can make investment decisions accordingly. Companies with Taxonomy-aligned activities will benefit from institutional investors, retail investors and banks interested in green investments, as they will be looking to finance Taxonomy-aligned economic activities.\n\nInvestors that want to make a positive environmental impact will be interested in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities because they will know the given activity lives up to the established gold standard; i.e., has a high level of environmental performance and makes a substantial contribution.\n\nInstitutional investors can design their financial products in such a way as to fund some Taxonomy-aligned activities. Those under the scope of the SFDR will have to comply with mandatory disclosures whereby they also need to show to what extent, if any, there are underlying Taxonomy-aligned investments in the financial products they offer.\n\nLarge banks might also have an incentive to finance Taxonomy-aligned economic activities, for example through lending. This means that a company applying for a bank loan may be able to get a better interest rate if the purpose of the loan is to reach Taxonomy alignment of a given activity, or to fund Taxonomy-aligned activities.\n\nRetail investors are increasingly interested in green financial products. Given the upcoming amendments to the requirements for portfolio management and investment advice, those providing investment services need to consider the client’s sustainability preferences as well as their risk profile. This opens a channel for retail investors to state whether they prefer to invest in financial products that have a positive environmental impact or to avoid investing in those that do not, so that they can be offered financial products that match their preferences. Taking into account retail investors’ sustainability preferences when they are given financial advice creates better opportunities for companies with Taxonomy-aligned activities to reach retail investors.\n\nWhile it is not mandatory for companies to ensure their economic activities meet the criteria of the Taxonomy, it provides a motivation for companies to strive to reach a level of environmental performance that financial markets recognise as green. The Taxonomy Regulation, along with the SFDR, CSRD, and ongoing policy initiatives such as the EU Ecolabel for retail financial products and the EU Green Bond Standard, will ensure that Taxonomy-aligned activities are visible and recognised in investment decisions. Companies that wish to make a substantial contribution to reaching the climate and environmental objectives can voluntarily decide to use these criteria when planning their transition to sustainability.",
  "318": "The EU Taxonomy criteria provide a reference point for companies in their decision-making regarding their green transition. Companies can use the EU Taxonomy to improve their overall environmental performance (either by upgrading current activities or starting new activities) and to attract investors.\n\nThe EU Taxonomy criteria are defined at the level of economic activities. Therefore, assessing the degree of alignment of a company with the EU Taxonomy requires checking the performance of its activities against the criteria.\n\nIn practice, the reporting procedures and resource planning will likely be organised at the level of the legal entity – or entities - of a given company. Legal entities would assess and report the percentage of their activities that are Taxonomy-aligned, expressed as the share of their Taxonomy-aligned turnover or expenditures (capital and operational). This information would then be aggregated across legal entities for the company as a whole.\n\nBy focusing on the activity level, the Taxonomy supports companies in their transition. It provides incentives to gradually increase their share of green economic activities to attract more investors or possibly new and different types of investors.\n\nKnowing the current environmental performance at the level of an activity will encourage companies to make transition plans and implement measures that get their activities to meet the EU Taxonomy criteria. By also covering capital expenditure linked to the transition plans, the EU Taxonomy can help attract investors searching for Taxonomy-aligned investments to finance the transition, helping both companies and investors to accelerate the transition to sustainability.",
  "319": "Businesses of any size, including small companies, can use the EU Taxonomy to explain to investors or stakeholders in general whether they carry out or plan to carry out Taxonomy-aligned green activities. Disclosures are only mandatory for large companies within the scope of the CSRD, but many small companies and businesses could find it useful to disclose the Taxonomy alignment of their activities on a voluntary basis.\n\nSMEs whose business models are focused on one green activity covered by the EU Taxonomy will have only one set of criteria applicable to their business model. For example, a small manufacturer of energy-efficient windows could check relatively easily what share of its turnover, capital expenditure or operating expenditure is related to the sale of windows that comply with the Taxonomy criteria.",
  "320": "As the answer to question 7 explains, not all economic activities are covered by the Taxonomy Regulation and its delegated acts. But this does not mean that the EU Taxonomy will be irrelevant to companies active in those sectors that are not covered. The[ TEG in its report ](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/publication/sustainable-finance-teg-final-report-eu-taxonomy_en)suggested that companies active in a sector that is not covered by the EU Taxonomy could use it for some of their expenditures into output of other activities that are Taxonomy-aligned (for example a hospital purchasing and installing solar panels, an energy efficient heating system or energy efficient windows from manufacturers that comply with Taxonomy criteria for these activities). The [Transition Finance report](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/business_economy_euro/banking_and_finance/documents/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en.pdf) of the Platform on Sustainable Finance also covers this question.",
  "321": "While the EU Taxonomy only reveals whether companies have Taxonomy-aligned activities or not, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive will require more detailed reporting on a broad range of sustainability issues, including environmental performance indicators. Based on that information, financial market participants can recognise different degrees of environmental performance that have not been categorised by law as Taxonomy-aligned.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to recall that (i) what does not qualify as a green economic activity under the EU Taxonomy is not necessarily unsustainable given the need to make a ‘substantial contribution’, and (ii) the EU Taxonomy does not constitute a mandatory list for investors to invest in. Thus, financial market participants can choose to invest in companies that carry out activities that have different degrees of environmental performance, including activities that do not comply with the EU Taxonomy criteria. In terms of further policy work, Article 26 of the Taxonomy Regulation calls for a Commission report by the end of 2021 on whether the Taxonomy Regulation should be extended to cover economic activities with no significant impact on the environment as well as economic activities that do significant harm to the environment. The Platform on Sustainable Finance will provide advice to the Commission to feed into that report, and the Platform’s[ report on Transition](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en) [Finance ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en)also covers this issue.",

Under the EU Taxonomy such improvements can only be qualified as Taxonomy-aligned if they lead to the substantial contribution threshold for at least one environmental objective being reached (without doing significant harm to any other objectives and if they comply with the minimum social safeguards). The Taxonomy Regulation identifies environmental performances that go further than simply refraining from doing significant harm.\n\nArticle 26 of the Taxonomy Regulation calls for a Commission report by the end of 2021 which will analyse whether the Taxonomy Regulation should be extended to cover economic activities with no significant impact, as well as economic activities that do significant harm to the environment. \n\nThe Platform on Sustainable Finance will provide advice to the Commission to feed into that report, and the Platform’s[ report on Transition](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en) [Finance ](https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/210319-eu-platform-transition-finance-report_en)also covers this issue. In its report the Commission could look into, among other issues, the question of whether and how to recognise improvements in the environmental performance of activities that are causing significant harm to the environment, even if that improvement does not meet the criteria established for substantial contributions in the EU Taxonomy, but the improvement leads to performance levels better than significant harm.

According to the Taxonomy Regulation, the Commission has to consult the Platform on Sustainable Finance, before adopting the delegated act on technical screening criteria. The Platform plays a key role in developing the technical screening criteria, as it provides indispensable technical and scientific input to the Commission and allows for a reasoned discussion among experts, reflecting the various stakeholders’ views.

This is in line with the principles enshrined in the [European Pillar of Social Rights](https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2017-11/social-summit-european-pillar-social-rights-booklet_en.pdf) in support of a sustainable and inclusive growth, as well as with the relevant international minimum human and labour rights standards. \n\nThe minimum safeguards are therefore an integral part of the Taxonomy and are one of the four criteria laid down in Article 3 which must be met for economic activities to be considered environmentally sustainable. The inclusion of minimum safeguards in the Taxonomy framework aims to ensure that entities carrying out economic activities considered as Taxonomy-aligned meet certain minimum social and governance standards. \n\nIn other words, the purpose of the minimum safeguards under the Taxonomy Regulation is to prevent activities and investments from being regarded as ‘sustainable’ if they involve breaches of key social principles and human and labour rights or do not align with minimum standards for responsible business conduct.",
  "326": "Article 18 of the Taxonomy Regulation lays down specific requirements for minimum safeguards referring both to international standards of responsible business conduct under Article 18(1) and to the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ of the SFDR(4)Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on sustainability‐related disclosures in the financial services sector (OJ L 317, 9.12.2019, p. 1). under Article 18(2). \n\nUnder **Article 18(1),** minimum safeguards are to be understood as due diligence and remedy procedures implemented by a company that is carrying out an economic activity in order to ensure alignment with the [_Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises_](https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf) _(OECD MNEs)_ and the [_UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights_](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) _(UNGP)_. The latter includes the principles and rights set out in eight of the ten fundamental conventions identified in the International Labour Organization (ILO) Declaration of the on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work(5)The core conventions of the International Labour Organisaiton are: _Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,_ 1948 (No.87); _Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention_ , 1949 (No. 98); _Forced Labour Convention_ , 1930 (No. 29) (and its 2014 protocol); _Abolition of Forced Labour Convention_ , 1957 (No. 105); _Minimum Age Convention_ , 1973 (No. 138); _Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention_ , 1999 (No. 182); _Equal Remuneration Convention_ , 1951 (No. 100); _Discrimination (Employment and Occupation) Convention_ , 1958 (No. 111), and the International Bill of Human Rights(6)This includes: _Universal Declaration of Human Rights_ (1948); _International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights_ (1966); and _International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights_ (1966).. \n\nThe [_OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises_](https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf) bring together all thematic areas of responsible business conduct and responsible supply chain management. It also recommends that enterprises apply good corporate governance practices, including due diligence(7)See also specific OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct (2018) and OECD sectoral guidance, available at: <https://mneguidelines.oecd.org/mneguidelines/>, which provides practical support to enterprises on the implementation of the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. as set out in the [_OECD Principles of Corporate Governance_](https://www.oecd.org/daf/ca/Corporate-Governance-Principles-ENG.pdf). \n\nThe [_UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights_](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) __ (i)specify a standard of conduct for businesses to prevent human-rights violations; and (ii) address any potential risks resulting from the economic activities that businesses conduct. The responsibility of business entities to respect human rights refers to internationally recognised rights understood, as a minimum, as those expressed in eight of the ten fundamental ILO conventions and in the International Bill of Human Rights \n\n**Article 18(2)** introduces a direct link with the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ (DNSH) referred to in Article 2(17) of the SFDR. This ensures that minimum social standards are defined at European level, and that there is consistency in European legislation. \n\nThe details of the SFDR’s principle of ‘do no significant harm’ are specified in [Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN) adopted by the European Commission in April 2022. According to this regulation, in addition to disclosing whether the sustainable investment is aligned with the OECD MNEs and UN GP, implementing the SFDR principle of do no significant harm requires the consideration of a list of principal adverse indicators. The European Commission considers that, in the context of the Article 18(2) of the Taxonomy Regulation, the link between the minimum safeguards and the principle of DNSH of the SFDR is to be understood, as a minimum, through the SFDR principal adverse impact indicators for social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters listed in the table 1 of Annex I of the SDFDR Delegated Regulation.(8)The methodology for the calculation of these indicators can be found in Annex I of the [Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN). The term ‘investee companies’ in table 1 of Annex I of the [Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN) corresponds to references to ‘undertakings’ in the Taxonomy Regulation.\n\ndata:image_3",
  "327": "Undertakings disclosing their alignment with the Taxonomy will need to assess their compliance with the Taxonomy’s minimum safeguards requirements under both Article 18(1) and Article 18(2). \n\nUnder **Article 18(1)** , undertakings whose economic activities are to be considered as Taxonomy-aligned must have implemented due diligence and remedy procedures to ensure the alignment with the standards for responsible business conduct mentioned in the [OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises](https://www.oecd.org/daf/inv/mne/48004323.pdf) and the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf) (see question 2). Both these texts extensively outline how the principles and conduct of due diligence can be implemented. \n\nThe central requirement under Article 18(1) is that an undertaking must implement appropriate procedures, including procedures to continuously identify, prevent, mitigate or remediate the relevant actual and potential adverse impacts connected with their own operations, value chains and business relationships in order to ensure their activities are carried out in line with these standards. \n\nSometimes, despite implementing all appropriate procedures, an undertaking cannot address certain risks or eliminate certain negative impacts. This does not necessarily mean that the undertaking does not comply with the minimum safeguards, provided that the undertaking has clearly disclosed these potential impacts and explained what it did to identify, prevent, mitigate or remediate them and why it could not eliminate certain impacts. In fact, it is recognised that there can be instances where, despite reasonable due diligence measures, undertakings may still not be able to prevent, cease or mitigate adverse impacts when it comes to the adverse impacts in the undertaking’s value chain. \n\nAs part of those due diligence and remedy procedures, companies are required under **Article 18(2)** to consider the SFDR principal adverse impact indicators related to social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters referred to under question 2(9)The methodology for the calculation of these indicators can be found in Tables 1 and 3 of Annex I of the [Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN).. \n\nThe only issue covered by Article 18(2) as of today which is not explicitly covered by Article 18(1) is the principal adverse impact relating to the exposure to controversial weapons as defined under the SFDR Delegated Regulation(10)[Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1288](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R1288&from=EN) (anti-personnel mines, cluster munitions, chemical weapons and biological weapons). Therefore, by virtue of Article 18(2), undertakings are to ensure that their due diligence and remedy procedures allow for the identification, prevention, mitigation or remediation of any actual or potential exposure to the manufacture or selling of controversial weapons. \n\nBeyond the provisions of Article 18(2) described above, the Taxonomy Regulation does not contain further considerations relating to weapons or defence-related equipment and technologies in the assessment of minimum safeguards. As stated in the [Draft Commission notice on interpretation and implementation of certain legal provisions of the EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act](https://ec.europa.eu/finance/docs/law/221219-draft-commission-notice-eu-taxonomy-climate.pdf)(11)Question 11 ‘ _How does the sustainable finance framework apply to access to private funding for the defence industry_?’, p.16., the Commission acknowledges the need to ensure access to finance and investment including from the private sector for all strategic sectors, including the defence industry. The defence industry is recognised as a crucial contributor to the resilience and security of the Union, and therefore to peace and social sustainability(12)See Commission’s proposal for [Proposal for an Act in Support of Ammunition Production](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2023-05/COM_2023_237_1_EN_ACT.pdf) (ASAP), COM(2023) 237 final..\n\nThe list of SFDR indicators related to social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery might change with potential future revisions of the SFDR delegated act. That is why any issue that may be addressed in the future by the adverse indicators of the SFDR will also need to be considered by undertakings according to Article 18(2). \n\nReporting in line with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive(13)Directive (EU) 2022/2464 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022 amending Regulation (EU) No 537/2014, Directive 2004/109/EC, Directive 2006/43/EC and Directive 2013/34/EU, as regards corporate sustainability reporting (OJ L 322, 16.12.2022, p. 15). (CSRD) will help companies to assess their compliance with Article 18 requirements and will help investors to get the necessary information from investee companies(14)The CSRD requires that the sustainability reporting standards that undertakings are required to use to meet their disclosure obligations contain the information that financial market participants need in order to comply with their disclosure obligations under the SFDR. In practice this means that undertakings will be required to report the mirroring information for the principal adverse impact indicators required under the delegated regulation of the SFDR. _Article 29b(5)(b) CSRD_. Article 18 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation does not require additional disclosures, there is therefore no duplication with the CSRD reporting requirements. \n\nFor further informal advice on best practices, users are invited to consult the [Final Report on Minimum Safeguards of the Platform on Sustainable Finance](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/system/files/2022-10/221011-sustainable-finance-platform-finance-report-minimum-safeguards_en.pdf) published in October 2022.",
  "328": "Recital 19 of the Taxonomy Regulation clarifies that ‘sustainable investments’ under the SFDR include investments into ‘environmentally sustainable economic activities’ within the meaning of the Taxonomy Regulation. \n\nIn setting out what is required for an activity to be considered as ‘environmentally sustainable’, Article 18(2) makes a link between the Taxonomy Regulation and the SFDR via one of the required steps of the Taxonomy Regulation: the compliance with minimum safeguards. According to the guidance given under question 1 and 2 above, the social elements of the ‘do no significant harm’ principle are considered to be adhered to at entity level for an undertaking that discloses activities as ‘environmentally sustainable’ under the EU Taxonomy. \n\nFurthermore, according to the guidance provided in questions 1 and 2 above, the SFDR do no significant harm principle and the requirement to ensure that an investee company follows good governance practices are deemed to be fulfilled for investments in Taxonomy-aligned economic activities as these comply with the Taxonomy’s minimum safeguards. The four aspects of good governance referred to in point 17 of Article 2 of the SFDR (namely sound management structures, employee relations, remuneration of staff and tax compliance(15)The [EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/eu-list-of-non-cooperative-jurisdictions/) was updated in February 2023. It provides useful guidance to identify countries which have failed to fulfil their commitments to comply with tax good governance criteria within a specific timeframe, and countries which have refused to do so.) can be considered to be satisfied by the provisions referred to in Article 18 of Regulation (EU) 2020/852. \n\nTherefore, such investments in Taxonomy-aligned ‘environmentally sustainable’ economic activities can be automatically qualified as ‘sustainable investments’ in the context of the product level disclosure requirements under the SFDR. This means that investments in specific economic activities can be considered to be sustainable investments. \n\nHowever, if a financial market participant (FMP) invests in an undertaking with some degree of taxonomy-alignment through a funding instrument that does not specify the use of proceeds, such as a general equity or debt, the FMP would still need to check additional elements under the SFDR in order to consider the whole investment in that undertaking as sustainable investment. This means that the FMP would still need to: (i) check whether the rest of the economic activities of the undertaking comply with the environmental elements of the SFDR DNSH principle; and (ii) assess whether she/he considers the contribution to the environmental objective sufficient.
